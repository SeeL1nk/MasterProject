For sugar-free flavors, I add a tad of grated nutmeg, vanilla extract, unsweetened organic dried coconut, pecans, and whatever fresh fruit I have on hand. Do not miss the sugar at all! I skip food in the AM, eat breakfast around noon (""Lunch"") and then have a regular dinner around 6:30. This allows me to observe an 8-hour intermittent fasting window. I do have an unsweetened acceptable beverage in the AM. Using this regimen, I have lost 20% of my body weight over a 4 month period. Keeping that up has allowed me to keep the weight off now for three years. My dinner includes 1-2 glasses of wine, now that I have achieved my desired weight. The more fiber I have at noon allows me to go without until dinner."
070f8a4c-0d37-4394-a88f-b640c4b20313;kate;3;Rather than using quick cooking oats, I use Old Fashioned oats and cook in the microwave for a little over a minute. Then I stir and add three pitted dates. And microwave another 30-40 seconds. Then I chop my dates up in the oatmeal with my spoon. And I add a few walnuts. No sugar, no milk!
6a4c65db-3c5d-41dc-b81a-3f0f23df6b0a;angelamcknight;4;I did use agave syrup to sweeten as I made it with milk not juice and plain yogurt. When I use vanilla yogurt, I don’t use juice but milk. but tonight I only had plain yogurt and no juice hence the use of agave syrup. Recipe worked for me.
6a4c65db-3c5d-41dc-b81a-3f0f23df6b0a;shalenaali;3;I used fresh squeezed orange juice, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries. Came out good and tasted good too. However, it was not very filling. Was still hungry after.
6a4c65db-3c5d-41dc-b81a-3f0f23df6b0a;jenniferbowyer;4;I have a nutribullet and only needed one serving so i halved it and added milk in place of the fruit juice. I did have to add a bit more milk since i was using frozen fruit. I did have to add some sugar though.
6a4c65db-3c5d-41dc-b81a-3f0f23df6b0a;pianoplayer;4;As some other folks were saying, the calories seem exaggerated for such a small drink. It did taste good, in fact very good. The flavors in my pallet were exploding. -Chase
6a4c65db-3c5d-41dc-b81a-3f0f23df6b0a;nmm;5;Loved the smoothe. To make my drink a bit sweeter I added honey.
6a4c65db-3c5d-41dc-b81a-3f0f23df6b0a;eatingwelluser;4;Great tasting and filling This is a great tasting smoothie! I like it because you can make any flavors you'd like. I use orange juice and mixed berries to make mine. I have NO idea why the carbs count is so high. I plugged the listed stats into my Weight Watchers online and it said 9 points. I freaked out and plugged each item in manually and it came down to 3. Don't go by these nutrition facts, I think they might be way wrong. Pros: Taste, filling, quick, versatile
2aa2a320-8182-43ac-8854-7bcb18a1da08;judie;5;Love this recipe and make it frequently. I add a sprinkle of salt and pepper and a few shakes of hot sauce. Also, I usually toast the bread.
2aa2a320-8182-43ac-8854-7bcb18a1da08;tumbarella;5;To switch it up instead of using mixed greens I’ll substitute with alfalfa sprouts or micro greens and sprinkle with some feta cheese. So delicious!
2aa2a320-8182-43ac-8854-7bcb18a1da08;katkin09;5;Delicious. I’ve made this twice- first time per the recipe and then the second time I added julienned sun dried tomatoes that I made into another spread with a food processor. I will never leave those out again.
2aa2a320-8182-43ac-8854-7bcb18a1da08;sarahe;5;My husband and I both really enjoyed this sandwich. Made it exactly as written and it was very filling. Definitely salad on a sandwich and a nice change.
2aa2a320-8182-43ac-8854-7bcb18a1da08;liz;5;This was really good, I sliced up mini sweet peppers and used those. Next time I might add some Everything seasoning or Crushed Red Pepper. ??
2aa2a320-8182-43ac-8854-7bcb18a1da08;laurah;5;Was not expecting this to taste so good! It’s a simple sandwich but even with no added seasonings, it’s delicious. I’m flexitarian, but love that it’s vegan. I used only 2 tbsp of hummus, and I recommend using quality local bread, if possible.
2aa2a320-8182-43ac-8854-7bcb18a1da08;ronhebert;5;Amazing Sandwich. I've been wanting it again, since Monday. So tasty and filling!
2aa2a320-8182-43ac-8854-7bcb18a1da08;patriciabaughman;5;Delicious and easy. I used organic multigrain sandwich bread from Whole Foods, and filled with salad, grated carrots and black olives. I sprinkled lemon juice and Trader Joe’s Chili Lime Seasoning on the avocado. Even 12 year old grandson loves this sandwich.
2aa2a320-8182-43ac-8854-7bcb18a1da08;mandystout;4;This recipe was tasty and super simple to make. I cut it up to make it look like a club sandwich and it make a beautiful photo!
2aa2a320-8182-43ac-8854-7bcb18a1da08;op4dave;5;Delicious
2aa2a320-8182-43ac-8854-7bcb18a1da08;joyc21;5;This sandwich was a hit and so easy to make using whatever you have on hand. I used just 2 tbsp. of hummus and loaded up on the veggies. I also used red and green bell pepper and roasted them in the oven along with some onions. This was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had and I didn't miss the meat.
2aa2a320-8182-43ac-8854-7bcb18a1da08;joyceeddy;5;If you make the sandwich with Ezekiel's sprouted whole wheat bread (160 calories for two slices) , King's Harvest plain hummus (3 Tablespoons = 1.3 ounces= 80 calories) and 1/4 of a medium Hass avocado (50 calories) , you are at 290 calories. The rest is just low calorie vegetables. A yummy and filling lunch.
2aa2a320-8182-43ac-8854-7bcb18a1da08;carlabenedict;5;This is an easy sandwich to make. Very tasty.
2aa2a320-8182-43ac-8854-7bcb18a1da08;victoriaseavermsrd;5;This recipe is so simple and so delish. It's easy to throw together, using whatever mix of veggies I have on hand.
2aa2a320-8182-43ac-8854-7bcb18a1da08;lisavalente;5;Love the concept of this sandwich. I sometimes add cheese and usually mix of the vegetables with what I have on hand. Today it was tomatoes, greens and carrots.
2aa2a320-8182-43ac-8854-7bcb18a1da08;penelopewall;5;Yum, love this lunch idea as a veggie-packed alternative to salad
aa472bb2-3591-4c38-a248-9a53173af83f;trishajinishshah;4;Nice recipe
aa472bb2-3591-4c38-a248-9a53173af83f;penelopewall;5;I love honeynut squash and this is my favorite recipe to make with them. It’s so simple but so good. I like to switch it up and add cardamom. I’ve also made with olive oil instead of butter and that’s great too. I like to baste a little bit halfway through using the melted butter that’s pooled in the squash.
aa472bb2-3591-4c38-a248-9a53173af83f;sarahbirnie;5;A warming and comforting recipe for the Thanksgiving table! Will definitely be serving this!
aa472bb2-3591-4c38-a248-9a53173af83f;chandnimanakchand;5;Definitely trying it!
aa472bb2-3591-4c38-a248-9a53173af83f;ursula;5;This recipe for honey nut squash can be summed up in one word: outstanding! This is the first time my husband and I have ever eaten it and it definitely won’t be our last! So easy to make and absolutely delicious!

98488b8d-fbc7-4b09-84f5-14a419b35345;ronna;5;My friend made this first, and shared the recipe, and the Korean chili powder with me. Where we live, the powder is easy to get, but only comes in big 1 kilo bags! I quadrupled the recipe, and added diced daikon for more crunch and texture. Very easy to make with a huge flavour return!
98488b8d-fbc7-4b09-84f5-14a419b35345;jkim281;2;"""Fish Sauce"" from different countries taste different. Using Thai Fish sauce makes this dish taste off... A LOT.

98488b8d-fbc7-4b09-84f5-14a419b35345;gustave;4;I and my cohorts at work eat a ton of kimchi (quick and easy) so I made a 10X batch. I used 2X the spice, 1.5X the fresh ginger, and added freshly peeled daikon radish cut into thin matchsticks for some further bite as cucumber kimchi is normally quite mild...so in a sense I used the cocktail I used for when I am making cabbage kimchi. Additionally I peeled (understanding that takes away some of the nutrients) and cut the cucumber into thicker smaller uniform pieces. As a kimchi aficionado who makes it often I and the guys really enjoyed this recipe, just needed to add a little more punch.
98488b8d-fbc7-4b09-84f5-14a419b35345;laynedawnwashington;4;I have not yet made this but could I add tomatoes to this?
98488b8d-fbc7-4b09-84f5-14a419b35345;catherinecarrlewis;5;wonderful! So glad to find this recipe. It takes me back to my days in Korea. So easy to prepare...a wonderful, healthy dish by itself or paired with most any grilled meat. Thanks for sharing! (PS I used Korean Garlic Chili Paste as that's what I have on hand) Pros: Easy, Healthy, Delicious!
98488b8d-fbc7-4b09-84f5-14a419b35345;eatingwelluser;5;Very good recipe. Nice side dish with fish & rice. Will definitely go back to this recipe again and again.
98488b8d-fbc7-4b09-84f5-14a419b35345;carswellrandy;5;I've made kimchi a couple of times. We love it. But, this kimchi is the easiest and among the most flavorful I've tried. The cucumber retains it's crunch and the flavor is phenomenal. My only complaint is the batch was small. The next time I make it (this weekend after hitting the farmer's market for good local cumcumber) I'll likely triple or quadruple the recipe. Outstanding!
4912deeb-8e78-4729-ba80-4cbffb029ec4;marsha;5;I will definitely be making this again!! Simple and easy. My family loved it!!!
4912deeb-8e78-4729-ba80-4cbffb029ec4;lindaburns;5;This is my go-to Thanksgiving side. I make it every year. It's absolutely delicious. Also, bonus, you can make it ahead of time and it takes just a few minutes to finish on the stove. This is an Alice Waters recipe so you know it's great!
4912deeb-8e78-4729-ba80-4cbffb029ec4;rivermistchris;5;The only thing I did different was to steam my brussel sprouts rather than boil them. I also let them brown a little. This was a side dish for salmon and german potato salad. YUM! Everyone at the table loved this!
4912deeb-8e78-4729-ba80-4cbffb029ec4;jgardiner12;5;i didnt add herbs but added sliced button mushrooms -so yummy i used red onions,sliced button mushrooms, 2 cups br/sprouts,and chopped bacon, a little oil. boiled briefly brs/sprouts and added to other ingredients ,cooked for short time. yummyPros: easy, and delicious
4912deeb-8e78-4729-ba80-4cbffb029ec4;carynrybs;5;Wonderul flavor and texture Loved it! Made a half recipe as a practice run last night and served with a roasted chicken. Used Applewood bacon from BB which was not too greasy so I just left the drippings in the pan, omitted the olive oil and used thyme for the herb and the lemon juice. Even my 11 mth old Zach ate it happily.
4912deeb-8e78-4729-ba80-4cbffb029ec4;eatingwelluser;5;This recipe is the best I've ever had with Brussel Sprouts. It is to die for. I had it at a friends home for Thanksgiving. I am making it today for my family. I will always make this recipe for Thanksgiving. Thank you!
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;ruthmarie;4;We really liked this recipe because it was full of flavor! It was too spicy for us though even though I only put in 1/4 of a serrano pepper (cut the recipe in half). We made it easier on us wimps by stirring in some low-fat Greek yogurt. We also stirred in the turmeric cauliflower side dish and just ate it all together! Yummy!
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;novicec00k;5;This recipe was AMAZING! I added more garlic than was called for and a bit more turmeric, cumin, and coriander, and subbed jalapeño for Serrano. Served it to two other people and they RAVED about it. Served about four. Was lovely and amazing. 10/10 would make again.
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;swarnaduttagupta;1;"In indian cooking this recipe needs to be meticulous.

6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;marcb;5;It was great!! Made a mistake and added 2 tsp of turmeric. Added a little bitterness but I offset that by stirring in a cup of frozen green peas. Will do the exact same next time I make it.
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;kaywakeham;3;I found this recipe to be a bit overwhelming with the spices. I like spicy food so I made some adjustments to the leftovers. I took about 1/2 cup of the chickpeas and tomato mixture and put it in a blender with a little bit of vegetable broth to make a paste. I then mixed it back into the rest and simmered it for another 15-20 minutes. This really smoothed out the flavors. Then I made some brown rice and put the chickpeas and tomato mixture over it. That was the answer. It really needed a base. I am now happy with the taste.
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;victoriawillard;5;I did exactly as another reviewer said, skipped the serano and replaced it with jalapeño. I also used olive oil for a more nutritional dish. It was absolutely delicious!
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;samanthasink;5;This was so easy and so tasty! Im putting it in my recipe book.It took me longer than the promised 15 minutes but most recipes take me much longer anyway. I didn’t have garam masala so I used black pepper, cloves, cardamom, nutmeg, and allspice. I used a jalapeño instead of a Serrano.I thought the chickpeas needed more flavor so I simmered it at the end for about 20 minutes.
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;novelnerd;5;Oh my goodness. This was SO good! I made some minor modifications to boost my veggie intake. After adding the tomatoes and letting them get up to simmer, I stirred in a healthy portion of cauliflower florets cut into bite-size pieces. I covered it and let it simmer, stirring occasionally, until the cauliflower was almost tender. I added in the chickpeas and a big handful of spinach, covered it again, and let it cook just a couple minutes more, until the spinach was wilted and the cauliflower was done. It made the portions (and fiber content) even heartier without adding many calories. Many days I eat it straight, but sometimes I spoon it into a high-fiber wrap. SO, so good!!
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;clairekillian;5;super good! my family liked it :) i am not a fan of spicy food so next time we make it i will def only add half or 1/3 of the serrano pepper! it is a new fan favorite in the house and one of the first recipes i made by myself. super cool !
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;morningchild;5;Made it as is (except substituted extra cumin for coriander since I didn't have any) and it was FABULOUS! I did remove the seeds from the serrano pepper and will leave them in next time for a kick. (I also now have coriander so am prepared for the next time) Served over brown rice and ate it two nights in a row - we both loved it - outstanding recipe!
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;cherylterdina;5;We loved this recipe! I skipped the pepper because I can’t handle too much spice and it was still delicious. I had some leftover butternut squash so I cubed it and added it to the dish which worked out fine. I served the curry over rice and made some naan on the side and it was so good.
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;esophagusteer;4;Liked It
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;abigailheiser;5;This recipe was delicious! I added some cauliflower roasted with garam masala and half a bunch of kale for a few more veggies, and it worked beautifully. Served it over cilantro lime rice. Super filling and keeps really well.
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;mkeissler;5;Really delicious. Easy with a food processor. My market didn’t have Serrano chili’s so I used jalapeños. I’m looking forward to eating leftovers!!
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;lynbrooks;5;This was awesome. Used two Jalapenos instead of the recommended peppers. Added whole cardamom pods. Doubled the spices. Even better the next day!
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;mercedesfreeborn;4;This is the first time I make the recipe and the first time I cook with chickpeas. It was not too salty for me (as others said) but the only thing is the chickpeas are really hard and I ended up letting simmer for much longer. I even cooked the chickpeas before for about 20 minutes and they were still super hard so I will try soaking them for next time. The taste is fantastic and I will definitely make again soon. I don't have a food processor so I used a grater for the ginger and a garlic press for the garlic and chopped the onion pretty small. I also used crushed tomatoes and added in some fresh ones. Overall delicious but soak your chickpeas!
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;alyssamorales;4;A very filling dish. If you have the time I highly recommend using dry chickpeas and doing a soak and long cook before adding them into the mixture in the last step. I'm not a fan of slimy chickpeas from a can, and I think it made the dish so much better. I ate it the curry in a flatbread with quinoa. Was a little spicy! Maybe next time I'll remove the seeds from the pepper.
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;hullomel;5;Excellent recipe. Quick, easy, and yummy. I used a jalapeño pepper as the store didn’t have Serrano peppers. I also added a teaspoon of curry powder at others’ suggestions. And I added spinach. Served it over white basmati rice.
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;miren;4;It was pretty good but I doubled the cumin and salt
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;elizabeth;5;Easy to make, low calorie and delicious. Really good.
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;tiffany;5;This was really terrific! Like others recommended, I did add some curry powder and unfortunately had to use powdered ginger because I forgot to pick up a fresh ginger root. I also like my dishes extremely spicy, so I used far more Serrano than was called for, and still added hot sauce to my own serving at the end! All the same, it was really delicious and we will definitely make it again. I sent the recipe to our daughter in college because it was quick and easy but still had bold flavors without a lot of work. A winner!
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;tannis;5;This was a really nice dish. I did add a teaspoon of curry powder as one of the reviewers suggested and it added that bit of kick so I suggest this. I made everything else in this dish as stated and did not find it too salty at all. This is a great healthy little dish. The key here is to use top quality Indian spices. I do a lot of Indian cooking and the spices are paramount to producing a good dish.
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;bethpedersen;4;Found this recipe via the 7 day vegan meal plan. It's on the menu for lunch today. I used 1 can tomatoes and 4 fresh tomatoes which I blended. I also added 2 carrots, 2 celery sticks and half a red bell pepper. I thought it was possibly over spiced when tasting it, so I added a little coconut milk powder to tone things down. It's pretty good! Thank you so much!
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;richhansonma;5;I split the recipe in half with no salt added tomatoes and no salt Garam Marsala. This recipe did not need any salt and I also added one diced and cooked chicken breast. I have never written a review of any recipe and what I like the most is this is a great bones recipe. Just keep adding the vegetables you like. Made brown rice with ginger and the other half of the pepper and half tsp of the garam spice and some steamed cut up asparagus. Now the rice has flavor that will not kill the spices in the curry. Great new low cholesterol recipe.
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;discodave;3;Alright so i tried this recipe multiple times. First time i tried it i didn't have the ground marsala so i used some local brand of curry u can find. Also i didn't have any of the low sodiuom diced tomatoes. And followed the recipe thereafter.... Omg it was soooo salty. So the second time i tried it i had it i had all the ingredients. I was so disappointed because it was still too salty. Since i don't eat meat or any type of white carbs. I give this a 3 only because if u try it alone you'll have my pproblems. But maybe over a bed of rice or some kind of pasta i hink you'll be ok.
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;ericbernardreiman;5;First time reviewer! I was feeling under the weather today, and as a vegetarian and lover of Indian food, I have always loved chickpeas and curries. So I searched today for something that was manageable that I could make without going to the store so I picked this! It was incredible. I made 2 changes though, because I like a little more kick. With the tomatoes and salt step, I added a teaspoon of curry powder. Also, I simmered a bit longer at the end because most recipes I have found have been around the 10 minute mark. It was superb. Thank you!
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;mintintoli1;5;I really enjoyed this! There is a slightly bitter aftertaste, but I’m not sure of the source (maybe because I used 1 cup of diced tomatoes with jalapeño and cilantro). Regardless, it tastes impressive for how little effort was involved! Would definitely try again and also incorporate spinach as suggested by another reviewer.
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;cindyo;5;O mah gawd, this was so good! I thought the spices would be overpowering, but it was lovely, and I'll be making this again soon!
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;kristina;5;*Note* remove the seeds from the pepper. I did not know to do that (might be obvious to others but, it wasn't for me). I absolutely loved despite how very hot it was. I will definitely make again.
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;texastoque;4;I made this for lunch today. It was flavorful, and quick to make. Added a half bag of frozen spinach for a little more substance, and color. Served it with brown rice
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;rachellydia;5;Simply delicious! I will make this once a week! My whole family loved it.
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;mindykoo;5;I loved this dish! My husband doesn't like when I do vegetarian dinners, but he really enjoyed this, and even went back for seconds. I didn't have serrano peppers, or cilantro on hand. I added some red pepper flakes at the end, and it gave it the little kick it needed. Will definitely be trying this again with the ingredients I was missing the first time around!
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;sharminsampat;5;Super easy and always love chole. I always add amchur (dried mango powder) as an extra spice to my chole. But this is a great alternative when I am out of it!
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;tea4two;5;This was fantastic! Only change I made was to add the entire can of tomatoes. It wasn't very spicy. It only served 5 (I used a measuring cup to portion out). I served over rice and made roasted cauliflower to go along with it. I will make this again.
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;verabentley;5;ive just finished making this for dinner tonite, its really yummy! i left out the original pepper & just added some chilli flakes at the end, yep, it needed 'something'. il do it again!
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;shaifulborhan;5;Just to add, if you can get your hands on some fresh curry leaves, this dish would be even the bomb in terms of aromatics.
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;monica;5;I love Indian food. This recipe is easy to make and was delicous. I used 1 tsp.of dry ginger since I did not have fresh ginger on hand. Served the dish on top of basmati rice. My husband lioved the dish.
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;chuck;5;Wow...really easy and really tasty! I was a bit worried about how spicy it would be...but it wasn't to bad. Although I did remove the seeds and ribs from the pepper before I made it. Still this was really good. Might work for a 'dip' as well...I used a tortilla chip for a taste while it was still hot...yummy! Definitely going to make this again.
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;rebecca;5;My family loved this I was concerned about spice level and deseeded the serrano pepper which definitely brought the spicy down but not the flavor. Also to bulk the meal up I added a bag of Boca Veggie Ground Crumbles and served over Jasmine rice. Our family talked and decided to add a second serrano pepper next time as we would enjoy the spice level being kicked up a notch.
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;dacook;1;Waaay too spicy hot! We put sour cream on it to cool it down and it still wasn't edible. I think the serrano pepper could be replaced with red pepper flakes or keep it out completely. It also needed a little something to cut the abundant tomato taste, like green peas, beans, kale, or spinach.
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;happyluckyblessed;5;Deeeelicious! This was my first time making any curry dish from scratch because I've always been intimidated but this dish is SO easy and tasty! Can use it as a side dish for main dishes or eat it by itself with pita chips for lunch. Very healthy!!! Love love love it! Made the recipe exactly as directed -- the only suggestion I have is to let it simmer a bit longer to let the flavors marinate -- Thank you so much for posting -- I just subscribed :) :)
6e0f2ef1-8bd6-4f7f-9fda-962cc7ea374d;penelopewall;5;My whole family (small children included) LOVED this. It definitely helps to have everything prepped and ready to go before you start cooking. I did not have the pepper so made without and it tasted great. The ginger added plenty of spice.
4d3c1620-1dfd-4652-8194-b0de3c434680;romeoromeo;4;Simple recipe. I cut the sugar down though, I only use 2 tsp. But I’m making this as 2 servings not 5. I use 72 g of oats and 2 tsp sugar, dash of salt, i add vanilla powder, I use 1.1 c of ripple for extra protein. I add mixed frozen fruit as well. The calories goes up to about 234 ps. This has to sit overnight and could be warmed up later if you want, but I don’t mind it cold. I don’t really like overnight oats, but this recipe is pretty good, plus filling! Protein is about 19.2g for 2, so 9.6 for one serving, you can also add peanut butter for extra protein, or protein powder. If you don’t like certain things about the recipe just cut it or add something else, make it your own. The blueberry overnight oats recipe from EW is good too.-Adding salt to a sweet recipe could balance a recipe out, so i would not skip it, unless you have a condition. That being said 1/2 tsp of salt does seem like a lot even for 5 servings, so adjust it to your liking or just leave it out.
4d3c1620-1dfd-4652-8194-b0de3c434680;attackeruser;5;Nice!!
4d3c1620-1dfd-4652-8194-b0de3c434680;brian;5;Exceeded my expectations! This is definitely going in to my morning breakfast rotations.
4d3c1620-1dfd-4652-8194-b0de3c434680;shalenaali;2;I used 1 tbsp sugar and 1 tsp vanilla extract. I used a combination of soy milk and almond milk. Had some of it right away. Was not very impressed. Maybe it will taste better tomorrow. The oats were soft enough.
4d3c1620-1dfd-4652-8194-b0de3c434680;suzngw;5;This was my first attempt at making overnight oats, I was skeptical not knowing if I would like the oatmeal cold. To my surprise it is absolutely delicious! I did use almond milk, splenda brown sugar and I also used 1 TBS of homemade vanilla (I love my homemade vanilla, no bitterness at all)! I do believe this will encourage me to eat a healthy breakfast now, as I have not been a breakfast person in the past. Thank you so much for this recipe, next time I will add some protein powder. =))
4d3c1620-1dfd-4652-8194-b0de3c434680;terryingramduff;5;Why not use dairy?
4d3c1620-1dfd-4652-8194-b0de3c434680;laura;5;This was delicious. I'm not a fan of hot cereal so this was perfect for me. I did use a bit extra salt and cinnamon after I initially tasted it, but that's just my preference. Next time I will add some chopped apples or banana. I used almond milk.
4d3c1620-1dfd-4652-8194-b0de3c434680;phambrook60;3;This tasted raw and so we microwaved it for one and a half minutes. A quick stir and it was a tolerable breakfast, but not the one I was hoping for.
4d3c1620-1dfd-4652-8194-b0de3c434680;sanbaralauraa;5;This is amazing
4d3c1620-1dfd-4652-8194-b0de3c434680;midnightflame2;2;This recipe was okay. After putting it together, it smelled delicious, but when eating it, it was bitter. I think this was due to the vanilla extract— since the oats are never cooked, the raw vanilla is too intense. I made it a second time with just a splash of vanilla and it was better, but still a bit bitter. Since the vanilla is really the only thing that gives this flavor besides the cinnamon, I think it would be very bland without any vanilla, but I don’t plan to make it again.
4d3c1620-1dfd-4652-8194-b0de3c434680;ipoems;5;"My husband has skipped breakfast for fifty years, until now! I make these up on Sunday night and he's good to go for the work-week. I use only 4 tsp of brown sugar and he sprinkles a tablespoon of slivered almonds on top after heating. I reuse the 8 oz glass jars ""better than bouillon"" comes in and they work great for 5 individual servings."
4d3c1620-1dfd-4652-8194-b0de3c434680;karenc;5;Such an easy recipe! I added protein powder too. It was a little too sweet with the vanilla extract so I’d skip that in the future.
4d3c1620-1dfd-4652-8194-b0de3c434680;heather;5;I will be making this recipe on a regular basis. Instead of 8 tsp of brown sugar I used 4 tsp brown sugar and 4 tsp stevia. Topped with blueberries and a sprinkle of walnuts or pecans. Delicious!
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;christinemerlino;4;"I liked this soup ...basically because it was low sodium. it IS low sodium because the ""only thing from a can is the canntillo beans...Thats why this is a ""soup to help lose weight/heart healthy too.In reading all these reviews""people are writing ""I substituted ""canned this, canned that""...Well guess what???? this soup is no longer healthy due to all the salt in canned products!...Is it ""really so HARD to cut up a few veggies???"
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;cebon;5;I really liked this recipe, and substituted a leek for the onion, red bell peppers for the green beans, one can of garbanzo beans for the cannoli beans, and canned dice roasted tomatoes for the Romas. I also added a can of roasted green chili and tripled the garlic, because I really love both! I've not topped a soup with pesto before, and feel like it's okay...I think it's the pesto I tried with a different Brand, I'm sure it would be great! Overall, a really nice, straightforward and easy veggie soup recipe!
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;evi;5;I have followed the recipe for this soup it has turned out delicious! Will definitely make it again - a really nice healthy soup, and all I add is a dollop of nice Pesto.
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;quintanakelley;5;This was sooo good! So simple, yet so flavorful.
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;renerich;4;Too funny! I made it today and we all liked it very much. My husband makes pesto all the time so we used it on top. I’ve added it to our monthly rotation as it’s easy and tasty. And then you sent the email tonight. I picked the right day apparently!!
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;islandsteph;5;I love soups. They are my comfort food and I love making large batches to freeze. Here is what I changed 4cups of chicken stock and 4cups of water. I also used no salt added Garlic & Herb seasoning to taste. I felt that this gave it a bit of flavor. I also added 4tsp of red wine vinegar for extra zing. I doubled most of the veggies. Looking forward to future batches where I’ll be throwing extra veggies and cabbage into the soup. Do not forget the pesto. It was perfection.
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;cathylutz;5;This soup was delicious. I used a carton of organic chicken bone broth and a carton of vegan protein broth. The soup had a little crunch from the veggies, great flavor, and the spoon of pesto was so good. This recipe is a keeper. Will definitely make it again.
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;darryconner;2;It was rather watery and bland. I followed the recipe exactly. The green beans were too crunchy for my taste.
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;sscottbh;5;Followed recipe, flavorful, hearty tasting soup, going into regular rotation at my house. Almost tried the slow cooker version of this recipe and am so glad one of the reviewers there made reference to this one. Mistakenly added vinegar by TB instead of tsp, no problem. Flavor was good with and without the pesto. Thank you for a great, healthy, tasty soup.
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;jilly;5;Tasty, satisfying and easy. Used spinach because I didn't have kale and some canned diced tomatoes. Love the fresh geeen beans. I sauteed per the directions but then put everything else in crockpot for couple hours on low.
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;katd;5;Did half broth and half bone broth and substituted cooked barley for the white beans. Loved it.
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;kjpmorgan;5;This is a delicious soup. I made the recipe exactly as written with all fresh vegetables but added one large bay leave while simmering the vegetables. I used fresh pesto from the market and it added a wonderful flavor. I love that it makes a large amount so I can freeze portions to have a quick healthy lunch or dinner. This recipe would be easy to personalize but I like it just as it is!
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;chriley;5;This is an amazing soup. I think most soups are loaded with sodium this is not. Why I love it. I like the option of adding A bit of pesto, makes it best!
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;trishmoreno;5;“Souper” good! Everyone loved it!
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;jackstng;4;Great filling soup with really good flavor. I've made it several times and keep thinking that next time I bet it won't taste as good but I've been consistently wrong. It's really tasty. Not sure about the comments regarding tastlessness, maybe they could try a different stock, more lemon or a different pesto? Mine was really good, even the kids thought so, and you know it's healthy!!! Big perk.
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;renate;5;Used all ingredients listed but then added my own spices since others said it lacked flavor. I used some Rosemary, Thyme, tons of fresh ground pepper and the Aldi version of Mrs Dash. Use your imagination, whatever spices you like!! I thought it was excellent & love using Kale vs. spinach as it holds up so much better & doesn't wilt. Will make again for sure!
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;buttons;4;First time making it. It was good, however I agree with others that there is not much flavor. I used spinach instead of kale because I do not like it. Added shredded Italian cheese on top. Also, I used a drained can of tomatoes
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;lex;2;Was filling, but lacks flavor.
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;judy;1;Omg what do people like so bad omg no flavour
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;carminebenedetti;5;loved it!! added Fresh grown Datil peppers and ground cayenne !! will make again maybe add another type of bean to add protein!
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;carlabenedict;5;I loved this soup. I recommend replacing the kale with spinach. It's great the next day.
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;scottangela7;5;I love this soup. I am eating the leftovers for lunch today. I make this about every other week just to have in the fridge through the winter so I can warm up a bowl to have alongside pizza or sandwiches instead of a salad. I have kept it at least a week in the fridge and it is still good. The only change I make is that I don't use the kale. I am not a fan of kale so either I use spinach or I just omit it. Thank you for the great recipe. So easy.....
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;junemorris;5;I made the Weight Loss soup last year. Instead of making the Full Recipe, I made half. Really good. I made this soup tonight 3/8/18 and made the Full Recipe. Really turned out good. My Grandson is here from College and he really liked the soup..
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;juniperberries;5;I absolutely LOVE this soup! I keep forgetting to top it with the pesto I got... but y'know... It doesn't even need it! The only thing I replaced in this recipe was I swapped the kale for some spinach! Absolutely fantastic, and I will more than likely be getting the stuff for another pot this upcoming week or the next!!
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;dezrah;4;This is a simple, solid vegetable soup recipe. The pesto definitely kicked it up a notch. This made a lot of leftovers but they've kept really well over the past few days.
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;vicki;5;This is delicious even without the pesto... actually forgot to add it.
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;jan;5;I have made this soup twice. Both times I sprinkled parmesan cheese over the soup before serving instead of pesto. When I made it with chicken stock vs. chicken broth, it was more flavorful. You have to be in a chopping mood to make this, but it is well worth it. I tried frozen green beans but was not as satisfied with the results as when I used fresh beans.
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;gdcasa34;5;Great simple vegetable soup with simple but good flavor. Great without the pesto but even better with it added.Tons of veggies, which is what I was looking for. Will keep this recipe on file and make again.
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;barbie;4;This was easy and most delicious. I was hesitant to add the pesto, tasted the finished soup and realized that's just what it needed to finish it off. I might simply add the pesto to the rest of the pot because it's that good with it!
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;woubre;5;Used cubed sweet potatoes instead of beans due to legume intolerance. Also used Trader Joe’s turkey bone broth - Absolutely excellent,
a04fc44e-a8f9-4066-8d17-6a2734fc9e0f;npjp;5;this is delicious,,,while I haven't added the pesto, the flavor is awesome!
1deaea11-f994-4585-bbbb-33f3ef4b3dc5;genisefolsompedrick;5;Easy and delicious! I cut the honey a bit, and left out the coconut, in a small effort to get the calorie count down.I will make these again.
1deaea11-f994-4585-bbbb-33f3ef4b3dc5;lkauffman;5;These are DELICIOUS. I used PB powder for the peanut butter, and did half honey, half maple syrup. I also used less than the half cup of the (sweetner) honey. Finally I added a scoop of protein powder. I will definitely make these again!
1deaea11-f994-4585-bbbb-33f3ef4b3dc5;jolene;5;A little sweet, so next time I might cut the honey back a bit. It's been helpful to have one late in the afternoon to tide me over until dinner.
1deaea11-f994-4585-bbbb-33f3ef4b3dc5;lexigirl17;5;I made these and I love them. Just the right amount of sweetness and chocolate. They satisfy me especially in the afternoon. I used a small cookie scoop which was about a tablespoon, and I am able to make 27-28 balls. I might add finely chopped walnuts in the next batch.
1deaea11-f994-4585-bbbb-33f3ef4b3dc5;amysierra;5;Normally I don't leave reviews, but these were just that good! Note, I'm allergic to coconut so I left that out, but they were good!
1deaea11-f994-4585-bbbb-33f3ef4b3dc5;shella;1;I haven't made these but in the verbiage at the start of this no sugar diet, it says these are made with dates and no honey, so this is a different recipe. Honey is still sugar, so this doesn't make sense to me.I'd still like the recipe for the one with dates (also sugar).
1deaea11-f994-4585-bbbb-33f3ef4b3dc5;mjcirre816;5;Excellent, satisifies the sweetness cravings. I used mini M&M's instead of mini chips.
1deaea11-f994-4585-bbbb-33f3ef4b3dc5;leahp;4;i followed to recipe to the T, and it gave me 22 balls not the 17 it says. but otherwise then that, its tasty. i don't agree these are low carb.
1deaea11-f994-4585-bbbb-33f3ef4b3dc5;gwalto13;5;Yes I made this recipe.I did make two changesI used one cup of rye oats with one cup of regular oats.And for the mini chocolate chips I used the 75% cocoa made with oat milk. I will make this recipe again.I paired it with half apple sliced.Yum.
1deaea11-f994-4585-bbbb-33f3ef4b3dc5;colecamacho;5;Everyone in the family really enjoyed these!!! Quick and Easy!! Great to freeze for later use or making in bulk.
1deaea11-f994-4585-bbbb-33f3ef4b3dc5;bunny;1;Certainly will not be on my low carb snack list!
1deaea11-f994-4585-bbbb-33f3ef4b3dc5;debbiehilliard;5;Love this recipe! Easy, quick, few ingredients and very adaptable. I made it with crunchy peanut butter and sunflower seeds instead of unsweetened coconut because that is what I had on hand.
1deaea11-f994-4585-bbbb-33f3ef4b3dc5;jennifer;5;"These are absolutely amazing...very filling and just the right amount of ""sweet"". I like to have as afternoon snack with some fruit."

f9245913-834a-46a5-aadd-5c72cb75a9c4;jeanie;3;The yogurt bark alone is good but added sliced strawberries doesn’t make sense. Berries are too hard and even chipits. You can break a filling. By the time you are able to eat the fruit, the yogurt is too soft.
f9245913-834a-46a5-aadd-5c72cb75a9c4;khredeemed;4;This was so yummy and a hit with all my friends! Plus it's healthy. You just have to keep in mind that after sitting out for awhile the yogurt will melt.
f9245913-834a-46a5-aadd-5c72cb75a9c4;majphd;5;Loved it! For those who are concerned about the hardness, recommend spreading thinner across a couple of trays - this makes it easier to chomp into
f9245913-834a-46a5-aadd-5c72cb75a9c4;laura;5;Love this recipe. I have tried it so far with strawberries, blueberries and nectarines. I will definitely teach it to my kids' class! (See youngchefpress.com.) I added julienned fresh basil and peppermint, and both worked well. When you serve this, it melts quickly, so you may have to return the platter to the freezer in between servings.
f9245913-834a-46a5-aadd-5c72cb75a9c4;will;3;32 servings? Pretty small, would not be worth it, honey already sweetens it. I make a similar with non-fat Greek yogurt. That will save you 324 calories, save you 36g of Fat. You could then increase your serving size 20% and have the same calories.
f9245913-834a-46a5-aadd-5c72cb75a9c4;galactichole;2;Cute recipe to try and tastes good but the yoghurt is far too hard when frozen but melts incredibly quickly when left out or refrigerated. Storing it was also impossible as all of the cut squares froze together. Just put strawberries and chocolate chips in your yoghurt and make life easier on yourself.
f9245913-834a-46a5-aadd-5c72cb75a9c4;viosanta;5;Just started healthy snackin and this is by far a favorite of mine now
f9245913-834a-46a5-aadd-5c72cb75a9c4;robin;5;I really liked this recipe. However, anyone have any tricks on how to keep it frozen but not too hard to actually eat? If I let it thaw is was just like a yogurt bowl (which was fine) or it was so hard that I actually broke a filling off my tooth trying to bite it.
f9245913-834a-46a5-aadd-5c72cb75a9c4;gail;5;Made this as a quick and easy dessert for a picnic. Big hit with everyone and ended up making a batch for me. Such a healthy alternative for me!
f9245913-834a-46a5-aadd-5c72cb75a9c4;cherylhigley;5;This is my new go to when I crave sweets! Wonder whether it could be made with a dairy-free yogurt?
f9245913-834a-46a5-aadd-5c72cb75a9c4;canderson1542;5;Very good, will make again
f9245913-834a-46a5-aadd-5c72cb75a9c4;penelopewall;5;This is sooo addictive and delicious and I love how easy it is to make.

baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;lorenlaughlin;5;These are the bomb! Doubled the recipe and used 2 cups oat bran and 4 cups rolled oats. Made them with half coconut sugar, half Swerve brown sugar, soymilk and substituted chocolate chips for pecans. Baked for an extra 5 minutes and they were perfect! So so tasty! This is a keeper.
baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;karenanderson;5;This is one of my favorite recipes. I double the recipe and freeze them. They are perfect for a quick and healthy breakfast. I substitute unsweetened vanilla almond milk, use half the salt, eliminate the sugar as the bananas have plenty of sweetness, and I add 2 scoops of protein powder.
baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;tragh1c;5;These are delicious - sometimes oatmeal muffins are a little dry and chewy but these are moist and tasty. Ate one with peanut butter spread and it was yummy!
baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;susanc;5;These are so easy to make! The texture is dense but moist, especially just after thay are baked and still warm. The level of sweetness is less than most store-bought goods which suits my taste just fine - I normally reduce the sugar in many of my dessert recipes. The fact that they have no gluten is such a BONUS! I find it difficult to find good gluten-free recipes to feed those in my family that cannot indulge. I am waiting to see how they hold up after a few days - still moist? Will let you know later, but for now, this is a real keeper!!!
baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;tallericokristi;1;I understand the recipe yields 12 muffins. The nutrition value is not for 12 muffins. What is the actual serving? Is it 1 muffin? How it is written sounds like if you eat 12 this is what you consume 176 Calories 6g Fat 26g Carbs 5g Protein

baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;bessa1963;5;Made these instead of my regular banana nut muffin recipe, my partner LOVED them so much, he wants these instead. More convenient to eat than oatmeal. I did sub the Splenda Brown sugar blend for the brown sugar and he is none the wiser.
baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;shalenaali;4;I used three different types of milk for this recipe and cut down on the baking time. It tasted good. I had 3 muffins in order to feel full. I only used 1 tbsp of sugar since I am trying to cut back on my sugar content. I would recommend this recipe.
baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;kim;5;No changes, just love them so much! I could eat these all day.
baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;tammyornelas;5;These muffins are so delicious! I didn't make any changes to them. They'll be great to take to work for a light breakfast.
baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;luu;5;Absolutely wonderful! I used bananas that were not super ripe but somewhat soft, hazelnuts, quick oats and precisely followed the rest of the recipe. They turned delicious! I don’t like oatmeal but these muffins are sure to stay in my weekly rotation. Thank you!
baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;margiel;5;I love these. Simple to prep in advance and have ready for a quick breakfast. I've now swapped out one banana for grated raw beet and strawberry mix. They also taste great!
baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;cmla;5;These turned out perfectly. A solid option for those of us trying to get our oatmeal in. A couple substitutions: I subbed in 1 cup of oat flour for the oats and I used date sugar to add a little extra fiber (and because we're avoiding refined sugar). I let the batter sit for a bit while the oven heated. Maybe that helped the oats absorb the moisture because they were done right at 25 minutes and were not wet as some other people mentioned. Very happy to have found this recipe!
baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;deborah;5;Thanks so much for posting this recipe as I had been searching for a recipe with oats and bananas and no flour. It comes out perfectly. I use black walnuts for their aromatic flavor and add a little cocoa to the mix. My new favorite recipe!
baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;yasmineshereen;4;I made this today as part of an Eating Well meal plan. This is supposed to be a healthier muffing so I wasn't expecting standard muffin texture, but I would try to make a few tweaks to improve. 1. I'd try to reduce the milk and swap the sugar with honey. The muffins needed to cook almost twice as long as the recipe states which makes me think the 1.5 cups of milk is a mistake or something. And, I just prefer the flavor of honey to sugar. 2. I saw one person say they added they did 3 parts oat flour one part rolled oats (or smthg like that), and I think this might be a good tweak. It's a flexible recipe and I liked it. No butter, oil, or flour, and still really tasty and pleasant.
baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;susanquinn;3;"These are what I would call ""earnest"". I eat them because I know they are good for me - not because I wake up and say ""yippee, I get to eat one of those cups I made"". They are dry and pretty flavourless."
baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;pm6411;5;This recipe turned out perfect as written. The only suggestion I would make is to mix the mashed banana and other wet ingredients together first and then add that to the oatmeal and other dry ingredients. Maybe the reason other people’s didn’t turn out correctly is how well mixed their ingredients were. I used nonstick muffin tins sprayed with avocado oil and cooked them exactly 25 minutes, let them sit the 10 minutes and they came out of the muffin tins perfectly. We thought the sweetness was just fine, I might add dried cranberries or cherries next time for additional textures and flavor.
baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;ronhebert;4;I jokingly told my wife that I was making suet cups. They are very rich and heavy. One is enough to last you until your mid-morning snack. Moist and full of flavor. We both loved them. Made according to the recipe. *REFRIGERATE! They will spoil if you leave them out for more than a few days.
baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;laura;4;I really liked this recipe! Especially yummy with a little bit of peanut butter on the side. Easy to make and baked up like a regular muffin. I may add a few chocolate chips next time, worth the extra calories
baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;ellenirwin;5;I substituted the 3 cups of rolled oats for 2.5 cups of Oat flour and 1/2 cup rolled oats . Also increased baking powder from 1tsp to 1tablespoon. It turned out great!!! I would add either some raisins or cranberries in next batch though.
baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;lynda;5;"I LOVE this recipe!!! It's easy, delicious and is my ""go to"" breakfast! I add more nuts than listed and include some steel cut oats for added texture. I often skip the vanilla because it just gets lost with all the other flavors. I feel off when I don't have these around. Thanks for this earth-shattering recipe!"
baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;psc;2;disappointed . came out very moist and little flavor. even tho added 20 min bake time. ended up breaking apart and toasted to get more of a granola effect. toasted in intervals for not to burn. this worked out fine , able to add to yogurt and fruit for a nice breakfast or snack.
baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;kellygrimes;5;I made these today, because I had old bananas. I was leery due to the fact it does not call for flour. I did add more vanilla and cinnamon. I also added some nutmeg and clove and some raisins. They baked up very well and the house smelled delicious. My daughter came down wanting to know what I was baking, because it smelled so good. When called we split one. Delicious! They have a different density because there isn't any floor, but they were very good. Yes, I will be making these again. I do recommend this recipe. I think next time I might try some dried cranberries instead of the raisins. You could even add some peanut butter. It's ok to experiment.
baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;goldie;5;Oops, I ran out of milk so I only added 1/2 cup, turned out fantastic, a little crispy on the outside and perfectly moist on the inside, next time I will try the raisin idea that was mentioned just because I love oatmeal cookies, so why not?
baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;public1946;5;Thought they were fantastic! But then I love banana bread. Unlike another commenter, I tasted lots of banana. Maybe the trick is using really ripe bananas.
baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;laughingwater;5;I replaced the brown sugar with a small banana. That gave the muffins a subtle sweetness and probably added to their moistness.
baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;dana;1;Absolutely disgusting! Better to find healthy MUFFIN recipe not a Cup recipe!
baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;lisavalente;5;I freeze these and just heat for busy mornings. When I make for my toddler I leave out the nuts and sometimes stir in peanut butter instead. Adult and kid approved in my house.
baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;christinagreeningcunningham;4;Delicious, quick healthy breakfast. This is perfect for mornings that require quick grab and go option.
baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;aimeeaballard;4;I added a bit more cinnamon, vanilla, and some nutmeg as well as dried orange peel. Plus I put pepitas in and some sliced almonds on top before baking. I wanted a whole meal! Mix was very wet but came out moist even though I added 5 min baking time. Plus I made in square pan since my muffin tin was mia. All in all a delicious bread.
baaeb0b8-bac5-4ef3-88a1-d5936213bc7d;debrakawaller;3;I’m sure these are healthy however they lacked flavor. Oatmeal was overpowering so didn’t taste banana. Needed some other flavoring too ie Cinnamon or maybe some raisins? Also needed a bit more sweetness. Loved the pecans in them. Crunchy oatmeal on top was nice. I spread on some homemade jam for extra flavor and sweetness.
16d158f0-5274-4916-8da7-47fcd716d4e2;jenny;5;The only ingredient that I did not have on hand was a shallot, so I minced yellow onion. I also did not use the cornstarch I just finished off heat with about 4T cold butter. Used as a sauce for vermicelli topped with grilled chicken. It was excellent!!
16d158f0-5274-4916-8da7-47fcd716d4e2;trainertroy;5;Very delicious and easy to make. Great for vegan dishes. Yum yum.
5204dada-7b2e-4d90-add9-2a93cdcf4ddc;zimmernb;5;LOVE this recipe! I add cooked shrimp and eat it as a main dish. Can't get enough of it!
5204dada-7b2e-4d90-add9-2a93cdcf4ddc;cathy;4;Very easy and tasty. I took some of the advice of previous reviewers and added a bit more sugar. It was very easy to make and served it with the Asian marinated pork tenderloin, steamed broccoli,and rice. It's a keeper of a recipe. Pros: Quick and easy Cons: None
5204dada-7b2e-4d90-add9-2a93cdcf4ddc;eatingwelluser;5;Refreshing and easy A wonderful simple salad. Refreshing easy side for any BBQ, it went over well at a potluck. Only thing I do differently is slice the cucumbers in half-moon shapes rather than making the ribbons, as I find that to be easier.
5204dada-7b2e-4d90-add9-2a93cdcf4ddc;jody;3;Summer Salad Good looking summer salad with interesting flavors. I will be adding this to my menu.
5204dada-7b2e-4d90-add9-2a93cdcf4ddc;honestie;5;This was absolutely wonderful! Very fresh and light, easy to make. Would go with any type of meal, not just Asian. This will be a new staple in our house!
c0775290-fbe3-4194-9cc4-a9b10fe76b25;judygoldin;3;I don't understand cooking the chicken one side only.I have never eaten asparagus and don't intend to when hearing it makes your urine smell and dehydrated you.To get your potatoes soft and lovely, par boil. Always.
c0775290-fbe3-4194-9cc4-a9b10fe76b25;debi;4;The chicken was a tad bit overcooked.
c0775290-fbe3-4194-9cc4-a9b10fe76b25;amby563;5;Easy and Delicious
c0775290-fbe3-4194-9cc4-a9b10fe76b25;flattoadgmailcom;2;I followed the recipe exactly. The vegetables were not done. so I took the chicken out and continued to bake the potatoes and carrots for another 20 minutes. Then added the asparagus. Ended up microwaving the potatoes and carrots then adding to the reheated asparagus and chicken. Not a success.
c0775290-fbe3-4194-9cc4-a9b10fe76b25;laura;5;I was looking for an easy asparagus recipe and came across this one. So all I made was the asparagus and the sauce. It was delicious! Next time, I'll make the complete recipe.
c0775290-fbe3-4194-9cc4-a9b10fe76b25;joe;4;This was a tasty and easy recipe. Like others suggested I doubled the sauce poured over the chicken and veges. The flavors are great!! I give it 4 stars because I had to take the chicken and asparagus off the pan and cook the potatoes and carrots longer. I thought I cut them small enough but I didn't. I also used a mega cookie sheet for this recipe. A regular sheet will probably be too small.
c0775290-fbe3-4194-9cc4-a9b10fe76b25;kbottomley;5;This was delicious and the sauce was very flavourful. Only thing I would say was that there is no way all that food with fit on one baking sheet, unless you have an enormous one! Also, I realize this may be personal preference, but I would double the sauce, and possibly even quickly run it through a blender to make it more smooth.
c0775290-fbe3-4194-9cc4-a9b10fe76b25;ndallas;5;This was really good. Even my son liked it and he is not a veggie (besides mashed potatoes) guy. I also added cherry tomatoes. Make more of the basting sauce so potatoes especially don't dry out too much it's also good to pour over the chicken and veggies when serving.
c0775290-fbe3-4194-9cc4-a9b10fe76b25;mombabomba;5;Tasty! I’m a slow cook but had this on the table in 40 minutes, including prep. Served w/couscous instead of potatoes. Will definitely make again, doubling the delicious tangy sauce. Very pretty plated, would gladly serve to guests. I don’t know how to cut chicken breasts “crosswise.” Google delivers conflicting definitions. Butterflied the breasts, and they were thinner than the specified 1/2” so I pounded only enough to even them out and shortened oven time to 10 min at 375, 5 min broil.
c0775290-fbe3-4194-9cc4-a9b10fe76b25;polly;5;We loved this. My husband said it tasted very gourmet since the flavors were distinct but not overpowering. My pan wasn't large enough so I couldn't cook in a single layer so I just added a little bit onto the cooking time. Broiled for same 10 minutes.
c0775290-fbe3-4194-9cc4-a9b10fe76b25;meganos;5;It doesn't get easier than a one-pan recipe. This is fresh and good!
b2022a75-851a-4178-861c-edf08e440d27;arithebelle;5;I had 6 pounds of sweet potatoes so I loosely tripled the recipe. I used an oversized metal cookie sheet and it fit it all perfectly. I followed the directions exactly by starting it out covered then removing it and turning the sweet potatoes every 15 mins. They came out delicious and looked just like the picture. Great side dish and I can see there’s definite room for your personal tweaks like maybe adding cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, nuts, etc like some other reviewers mentioned!
b2022a75-851a-4178-861c-edf08e440d27;carolsimpson;5;I did, I added a little honey, maybe a little less than a teaspoon and cut one granny smith apple (1 1/2) to introduce another flavor. turned out great and my husband loved it. Thanks
b2022a75-851a-4178-861c-edf08e440d27;penelopenotson;5;I made this as a substitute for the normal canned yams at Thanksgiving. Everyone really liked them and raved about how they were sweet, but not too sweet. I kept the fact they were healthy hidden. )
b2022a75-851a-4178-861c-edf08e440d27;pattieduca;5;Like many, making these forever. An excellent do ahead recipe. I add a splash of vanilla and oj instead of lemon. Can never make enough! Your oven quirks should be taken into consideration, lest you get mashed potatoes! I cover a bit longer, but crank up convection to 425 to brown w/o overcooking.
b2022a75-851a-4178-861c-edf08e440d27;austinjenkins;5;Love the maple syrup, goes really well with sweet potatoes. A perfect alternative to the oily dipping I've been accustomed to.
b2022a75-851a-4178-861c-edf08e440d27;petajohnston;5;Absolutely amazing, totally love this recipe. I have always loved sweet potato but this takes them to a whole new level. This will now be a regular in our house!
b2022a75-851a-4178-861c-edf08e440d27;jenniferkurth;5;Maple roasted awesome sweet potatoesI made these in advance for Thanksgiving and couldn't help but taste test them .. Awesome, never mind mashed sweet potatoes its going to be roasted from now on! Can't wait to serve these on Thanksgiving, I know everyone will love them ! Pros: Easy to put together .
b2022a75-851a-4178-861c-edf08e440d27;patsims;5;The flavor of this dish was so poignant and delicious! Not too sweet! Not too heavy! Candied yams are one of my favs, but Maple-Roasted Sweet Potatoes are now my new fav! Absolutely loved this dish!!
b2022a75-851a-4178-861c-edf08e440d27;eatingwelluser;4;Thanksgiving hit! These were a hit for Thanksgiving this year. So delicious but so easy. I left them in a little longer which caused them to brown a little but everyone loved them anyway. So good my mother-in-law asked me to make them for Christmas! Pros: easy
b2022a75-851a-4178-861c-edf08e440d27;yellowapple30;5;Great on the Grill These are fantastic as directed, but these can also be done on the grill for days you don't want to blast an already hot house with more heat. I make foil packets for these, divide them into servings, and toss them on the grill (cooking times vary according to temp level). The maple syrup or honey caramelizes, which is divine. I love the other variations reviewers suggested: add cinnamon, swap orange for the lemon, use honey. Fantastic alternative to heavy, cream-based mashed potatoes.
b2022a75-851a-4178-861c-edf08e440d27;nicolebarnhouse;5;This was AMAZING. I cannot believe that so little butter, no brown sugar, and a small amount of maple syrup could make sweet potatoes so sweet. This is a super change from my family's other recipe butter, sugar, and more butter and sugar topped with more butter and sugar. :)
b2022a75-851a-4178-861c-edf08e440d27;ironorchid;5;I used olive oil instead of butter, it adds more flavor to potatoes. There is no need to cover the potatoes at the beginning of the cooking. And 50 minutes of total cooking is too much. The dish is ready within 30-40 minutes.
314b2780-50d6-4e5e-9aba-55d8e70569a0;judygoldin;4;Looks lovely but I'd use spinach and par boil the potatoes. I always do.
314b2780-50d6-4e5e-9aba-55d8e70569a0;jmarquez01;4;Tasted great and easy to make. Added extra Italian seasoning, parsley and sliced lemons at the end. I skipped the Tarragon and not a fan of kale. Drained the oil and just used chicken broth to cook the potatoes. I didn't have roasting pan so I just covered it with a lid and finshed cooking the meat on the stove top. Family loved it! It's a keeper.
314b2780-50d6-4e5e-9aba-55d8e70569a0;cherylterdina;3;Too lemony. I used about 50% more chicken and 1/2 of a lemon and it was just too much for us. I used spinach instead of kale since that's what I had and we did find that most of the lemon flavor was in the spinach so maybe using kale would be better. This dish smelled great but I probably won't make it again.
314b2780-50d6-4e5e-9aba-55d8e70569a0;joann;5;Tried out this recipe for dinner tonight and it was amazing. I used half the lemon and it bit more garlic and seasoning. While definatly add this to my recipe rotation.
314b2780-50d6-4e5e-9aba-55d8e70569a0;bananalaayed;5;Amazing .. I made 2 changes (used chicken breast instead of thighs+ cayanne pepper instead of tarragon).
314b2780-50d6-4e5e-9aba-55d8e70569a0;erinbrotrophy;5;I used fresh oregano instead of tarragon and a mix of spinach and arugula due to availability. It was delicious and my family were surprised how much they liked it. Love the simplicity one pot meal I will definitely make this again.
314b2780-50d6-4e5e-9aba-55d8e70569a0;jen;4;Although really interesting in theory, the chicken didn’t pack enough flavor for me. One fix could be to marinate the chicken in the broth, garlic, lemons overnight but that drastically alters the prep time. Good in theory but for me the flavors need more time to come out and pack a big punch
314b2780-50d6-4e5e-9aba-55d8e70569a0;julzw66;1;I used spinach instead of Kale. This was way too lemony. It looked so good, but was really not good.
314b2780-50d6-4e5e-9aba-55d8e70569a0;cjbutterbaugh;3;Made the recipe as stated except used herb salt. The lemon was very overpowering and was all I could taste when eating the kale alone. Will try it again, but only use a half a lemon and resubmit with the results.
314b2780-50d6-4e5e-9aba-55d8e70569a0;mrigual;5;I love the simplicity and big flavor of this dish. The lemon slices are more potent than lemon juice would have been and the kale adds a slight bitterness that is lovely. For 3 people, I used 4 smallish chic thighs, 6 gold potatoes, and as much kale as I could fit in my skillet (which wasn't much). The recipe calls for 6 cups of kale, but if you watch the video you see them use just a handful or two. I was much more like the video. The potatoes cooked perfectly using the recipe's time guidance. It was delicious with dried tarragon, but I hope to have fresh next time to see what it will add. I'm adding this to my recipe box.
314b2780-50d6-4e5e-9aba-55d8e70569a0;irene;4;I didn’t have room to put everything together in one pan, so I had to bake the chicken separate from the potatoes and spinach ( didn’t have kale on hand) in the oven. Same ingredients except I had to omit the chicken broth. Very flavorful. Potatoes crisped up very nicely. Kale would’ve been even better! 4 stars because I had to change it up but truly was delish. Thank you!
314b2780-50d6-4e5e-9aba-55d8e70569a0;jeanc;5;Okay, so I made it a little more fattening. I dredged the chicken thighs in flour seasoned with salt and pepper, reduced the EVOO and added a little butter, and used regular chicken broth. Delish. We will make again.
314b2780-50d6-4e5e-9aba-55d8e70569a0;jojojojo;5;Even the kids liked this one. I skipped the Tarragon and Salt. After tasting, they were not missed. The lemon gave such flavor. I also used the whole can of low salt chicken broth. The salt in that was enough to flavor. After cooking in the oven for the time recommended, I put back on the stove to cook the potatoes better. I will definitely cook this one again!
314b2780-50d6-4e5e-9aba-55d8e70569a0;amy;5;I made this recipe as written and we really enjoyed it! We had plenty of lemon flavor and the tarragon was subtle, which was fine for us. I would use fewer potatoes, maybe 12oz of fingerlings. I also had trouble fitting it all in the pan, so I may try a baking dish next time as suggested by others. Will definitely make again.
314b2780-50d6-4e5e-9aba-55d8e70569a0;libbytaylor;4;I didn’t change anything in this recipe. I really liked this one. My kids are super picky, but we’re not short order cooks in this house. It was not one of their favorites but I will save it and make it again. I served it with a side of sweet corn off the cob.
314b2780-50d6-4e5e-9aba-55d8e70569a0;dk2018;5;I made this but I eliminated the kale. Used one breast and one thigh. I have made it again the same week. Only for myself. I love this.
314b2780-50d6-4e5e-9aba-55d8e70569a0;ridgerunner;5;My family loved this! Lemon bright (leave the peels on!) and tasty, simple and healthy and a great way to introduce a little kale into the lives of the adolescent set. I made this exactly as written except used a 9x13 glass baking dish for the baking part of things as my skillet was not quite big enough to hold all this goodness. Also....I suspect that it cooks a little more evenly that way.
314b2780-50d6-4e5e-9aba-55d8e70569a0;corywilcox;2;Overall bland. The lemon flavor was barely noticeable. The potatoes had no flavor and because they sit in the chicken stock, they weren't crispy. Used spinach instead of kale and it was the only thing that tasted good.
74d304df-ab03-4d4e-94e3-d89c3f8ba96b;sonyaa;5;Very easy to throw together and it tasted great.
74d304df-ab03-4d4e-94e3-d89c3f8ba96b;jenniferarnott;5;I made orzo, using chicken broth and after draining it, put it in the pan with the shrimp and spinach , mixed it all together and served it in a wide bowl. It was delicious!
74d304df-ab03-4d4e-94e3-d89c3f8ba96b;georgesfamilynova;4;Delicious flavors, easy to prepare, and healthy. Yum!
74d304df-ab03-4d4e-94e3-d89c3f8ba96b;ericacabello;5;Um...shrimp tacos baby! With butter lettuce or Almond flour Tortillas.
74d304df-ab03-4d4e-94e3-d89c3f8ba96b;bobbimccarthypaul;4;Pretty good. I used as a base and added: chick pea pasta, more lemon, some ghee in place of some of the oil for shrimp, a tablespoon -ish of half&half, grated pecorino Romano on top along with the zest. I agree to be careful with garlic, but my stove runs a bit hot at low-med. I only do the garlic til I smell it. I also don’t really measure to cook eyeball it. Overall a very good meal.
74d304df-ab03-4d4e-94e3-d89c3f8ba96b;marty;1;Burnt garlic tastes bad. There is far too much liquid in each step of this recipe, it ends up a soggy mess that tastes mostly like burnt garlic. Don't ever cook garlic for that long!
74d304df-ab03-4d4e-94e3-d89c3f8ba96b;delena;5;Love this recipe. Quick and easy. It tastes great too!
74d304df-ab03-4d4e-94e3-d89c3f8ba96b;kehillmd;5;This is so easy and quick and DELICIOUS. It fits into every diet plan and it doesn’t even feel like a diet! It will remain in my rotation.
74d304df-ab03-4d4e-94e3-d89c3f8ba96b;ljl;5;We’ve made it twice. Quick, easy, and delicious. Once we added Old Bay to the shrimp, but it didn’t really need it. Might try some smoked paprika next time. Definitely adding to our rotation.
74d304df-ab03-4d4e-94e3-d89c3f8ba96b;palzmarysue;5;Quick and easy. If you make sure the garlic gets browned, the dish will taste garlicky-nice. Will definitely make again.
74d304df-ab03-4d4e-94e3-d89c3f8ba96b;weslie;3;We made with kale (since that is what we had). Shrimp remained stubbornly boring rather than good and garlicky. With chopping up the kale, too much work for quite boring output
28691924-9c94-4e25-acd8-e71efbd8c2ab;allisonmorgan;5;So freaking good and very easy. Looking forward to making this for company so I can show off a bit!!
28691924-9c94-4e25-acd8-e71efbd8c2ab;chasingjoy;4;I cooked it on roast in my multi-purpose air fryer to 120 degrees. The skin was nice and crispy. The flavors were great. I wouldn't hesitate to make this again.
28691924-9c94-4e25-acd8-e71efbd8c2ab;bethhenkel;5;This recipe is marvelous! Follow the recipe, you can't go wrong. We always make a double batch, then have leftovers for breakfast. Great with a half bagel for a treat.Bon appetit!
28691924-9c94-4e25-acd8-e71efbd8c2ab;pewterdragon;5;I rated it just on the ingredients list. Haven't tried it yet, but looks yummy. I LOVE salmon and recently discovered the BEST way to cook it: in an AIR FRYER! This would be an ideal recipe for that method, as the topping is a paste (completely dry topping might blow off). I grew up on salmon (lived in Seattle) and using the air fryer was such a fantastic discovery! More forgiving (won't get tough in an instant if you go just that much too long, and you can check it without losing the heat, as you might when repeatedly opening the oven) and it keeps the inside moist while crusting very well on the outside. Reheating the fish works better (leftovers), too, as it isn't all dried out in the first place!HIGHLY recommend using your air fryer, if you're lucky enough to have on. Will be trying this recipe in the next few days and am pretty sure I'll love it!
28691924-9c94-4e25-acd8-e71efbd8c2ab;foode;5;This was great. I eat salmon once a week so I am always looking for new ways to make it. I can’t believe how good this was. Buttery with no butter. I served it with mashed potatoes and Brussel sprouts. Great comfort meal!
28691924-9c94-4e25-acd8-e71efbd8c2ab;matthewwoodward41;5;This was fantastic and will be added as one of our favorite ways to have salmon.I didn’t have skinless salmon so I made the recipe as written except that I cooked it in a cast iron skillet. I heated up 2 tablespoon's of olive oil over med-hi heat and seared the salmon, skin side down, for 3 minutes before transferring to the oven.
28691924-9c94-4e25-acd8-e71efbd8c2ab;juliamacmackenzie;5;Super simple and very tasty! Would definitely season the salmon first next time, but we really enjoyed it!
28691924-9c94-4e25-acd8-e71efbd8c2ab;karenhastings;5;This recipe has it all - delicious, quick and easy. Loved the flavors and the whole family enjoyed it!
28691924-9c94-4e25-acd8-e71efbd8c2ab;happycook;5;I made this for dinner tonight and my picky teen daughter loved it. It was delicious! Very easy and simple to make, I wouldn't change a thing. The crunch on top of the salmon and combination of spices made this a winner. Served with a side of roasted asparagus.
28691924-9c94-4e25-acd8-e71efbd8c2ab;mirahs;5;I did not have fresh rosemary, so subbed dried, but otherwise followed the recipe as stated (with perhaps a bit more lemon zest-I didn't measure). It was delicious and hubby said this recipe is a keeper!
28691924-9c94-4e25-acd8-e71efbd8c2ab;amie;5;This recipe was woinderful and full of fun flavors.
28691924-9c94-4e25-acd8-e71efbd8c2ab;jamesparis;5;This was amazing! Perfectly cooked fish. The walnut and panko topping remained satisfyingly crunchy. The dijon mustard paste added great flavor that everyone liked.
28691924-9c94-4e25-acd8-e71efbd8c2ab;christyn;5;Hands down this has become our favorite way to prepare salmon. I love the mustard dressing with the walnut topping - such a wonderful combination with the salmon! It's also pretty easy to make but impressive when serving!
28691924-9c94-4e25-acd8-e71efbd8c2ab;ekm;5;Amazing! Will be adding this to a weekly rotation.
28691924-9c94-4e25-acd8-e71efbd8c2ab;elizabethpayne;5;Made it for my family and they loved it! Super easy recipe to double. Served it alongside asparagus for a delicious meal.
28691924-9c94-4e25-acd8-e71efbd8c2ab;patti;5;Loved it! Prettu much followed recipe, DELICIOUS!!! Easy
28691924-9c94-4e25-acd8-e71efbd8c2ab;kathim;5;I love salmon almost any way you can make it, but particularly enjoyed this flavor combination with lemon squeezed over the salmon before serving. The crunch from the topping was an added bonus. Will definitely make this again.
28691924-9c94-4e25-acd8-e71efbd8c2ab;mazinggrace;5;I don't particularly like fish but this was quite good. Very easy to make - 10 minutes in the preheated oven was perfect. Followed the recipe pretty closely..except a little heavier with the dijon and garlic, and I had no red pepper. It turned out very tasty and will definitely make it again.
28691924-9c94-4e25-acd8-e71efbd8c2ab;allison0607;5;Delicious! Made as directed and family agreed it was a five-star meal. Next time I may squeeze some lemon juice over my plate for a little added lemon zing.
28691924-9c94-4e25-acd8-e71efbd8c2ab;margie;5;Made pretty much as directed. Excellent.
28691924-9c94-4e25-acd8-e71efbd8c2ab;selenecohen;5;I made this last night! I loved it . Thank you!
28691924-9c94-4e25-acd8-e71efbd8c2ab;shannonluloff;5;Fabulous dish- Best salmon dish I have made.
28691924-9c94-4e25-acd8-e71efbd8c2ab;juliel;5;Simple and delicious, I've already made it twice. First time I didn't have fresh rosemary, but second time I did. Great, either way.
28691924-9c94-4e25-acd8-e71efbd8c2ab;barbbee;5;Best salmon recipe l’ve ever tried.??????
28691924-9c94-4e25-acd8-e71efbd8c2ab;annhenthorn;5;Delicious! We eat salmon often, and this recipe is definitely at the top of our list!
28691924-9c94-4e25-acd8-e71efbd8c2ab;shana;5;This was yummy! Tasted like butter even though there is none. Nice texture with the coating.
0c7480cb-6bd9-4f62-81f1-ef54b30c3beb;yumalicious321;5;This is one of my favorite smoothies! I use regular cow's milk, and I had vanilla Greek yogurt on hand so I used that. I didn't need to add any maple syrup or honey but I'm sure that would be fabulous, too. The flavor is just sweet enough and the consistency is perfect for me. I love this recipe!
0c7480cb-6bd9-4f62-81f1-ef54b30c3beb;jacrand;2;It's so frustrating to never be able to see smoothie recipes for people like me who don't like milk or milk products. Even vegan protein tastes like milk! If anyone has recipes, please share. My dilemma is knowing I need protein added.
0c7480cb-6bd9-4f62-81f1-ef54b30c3beb;tinahinojosa;5;Pleasantly surprised as this was something I was not looking forward to trying. Tastes like a banana milkshake and mine wasn't nearly that shade of green. Chia seeds are not detectable once it is blended and the spinach really adds no flavor. It was a little too thick for my taste, so I added another 1/4 cup almond milk. I don't eat a lot of sugar so it was sweet enough without added sweeteners. Definitely will have this again.
0c7480cb-6bd9-4f62-81f1-ef54b30c3beb;tiggeresq;4;This is a good smoothie. I am new to adding spinach to a smoothie, you cannot taste it at all. I do modify the ingredients a bit. I use regular plain, low-fat yogurt, I use soy milk, and I don't add any sweetener, it is plenty sweet with the fruit.
0c7480cb-6bd9-4f62-81f1-ef54b30c3beb;thuber;5;Quick and easy! This smoothie is creamy, thick, and sweet. I thought it was delicious and could eat this everyday! I felt full and satisfied after finishing it. I highly recommend this recipe!
0c7480cb-6bd9-4f62-81f1-ef54b30c3beb;jilly;5;Another fantastic recipe I was happy to discover. I used lite coconut milk. I didn't add maply syrup or honey because I didn't feel it needed it. It kept me full for a good 4 hours - yay!!
0c7480cb-6bd9-4f62-81f1-ef54b30c3beb;rautaasta3;4;Fav drink
0c7480cb-6bd9-4f62-81f1-ef54b30c3beb;maq27;5;This is Awesome! I try it when I heard about it while I was reading on a website Will definitely make now again as nowhere I remind it.
0c7480cb-6bd9-4f62-81f1-ef54b30c3beb;aktaylor;5;Really loved this smoothie. I used coconut milk instead of almond and an un-frozen banana.
0c7480cb-6bd9-4f62-81f1-ef54b30c3beb;kristi;5;This was really good. I was scared of the spinach but couldn't taste it. It didn't keep me full for long but the taste was so good!
0c7480cb-6bd9-4f62-81f1-ef54b30c3beb;gina;5;I made this today and was amazing. Had no frozen banana so used a medium one like it indicates and did not use honey or maple syrup as it is optional and to be honest it did not needed it. Thanks a bunch for such delicious recipe and quite easy.
0c7480cb-6bd9-4f62-81f1-ef54b30c3beb;nevie;4;Pretty good! I made a few substitutions based on what I had available. I used plain whole-fat yogurt instead of nonfat Greek, 1/4 cup pineapple chunks (not frozen), and 2-3 tbsp hulled hemp seeds instead of chia. I eyeballed the spinach w a couple handfuls, so probably more than a cup. I also forgot to add any maple syrup or honey, though I meant to. It turned out pretty yummy, even with less pineapple than recommended and no sweeteners and more spinach (and hemp) than recommended. It wasn't too thick, and mostly tasted of banana with no spinach taste. My 8mo baby demanded a taste, and ate a few baby spoonfuls himself. Just the sliced up banana being frozen was enough to make the smoothie really cold, even though my pineapple was just refrigerated. Very quick and surprisingly filling.
0c7480cb-6bd9-4f62-81f1-ef54b30c3beb;raisinhell91;5;This was great! I didn't quite have enough almond milk so made up for what I was missing with a splash of pineapple juice. Used vanilla Icelandic skyr in place of the plain Greek yogurt. Will definitely make again.
0c7480cb-6bd9-4f62-81f1-ef54b30c3beb;amanda;5;So good! I added 2 tsp.organic coconut shreds,1 tsp vanilla, and 2 organic celery sticks. One stick mixed in and one sitting whole in the smoothie to eat. Also added some coconut shreds on already made smoothie. The extra celery and coconut on top make it look so cute and yummy! Mmmmmm lol. Oh I did half c. coconut-pinneapple water and half c. milk. (Ran out of my Silk so had to use whole milk) ?? Plus some ice cubes...
0c7480cb-6bd9-4f62-81f1-ef54b30c3beb;stevenekman;3;I use fresh pineapple, and also smooth milled flaxseed from manitobaflax.com. This allows you to skip the chia seeds. Flax gives you all of the benefits of chia and then some, so you can skip taking chia!
0c7480cb-6bd9-4f62-81f1-ef54b30c3beb;hillaaraujo;5;Absolutely delicious!! I made this without the greek yogurt and added coconut milk instead and it came out amazing! I will make this everyday and I'm sure both my husband and daughter will love it too! No more going to jamba juice when we can make it at home for a fraction of the price!! Nice job and thank you for the recipe!!
0c7480cb-6bd9-4f62-81f1-ef54b30c3beb;davinajacobs;5;Delicious , mostly taste the banana. Very quick and easy to make, filling, although it was very moreish. I added a little cucumber to mine also. Definitely recommend this to anyone that doesn't like to eat greens or veg. The spinach is nutritious but you cannot taste it.
0c7480cb-6bd9-4f62-81f1-ef54b30c3beb;eatingwelluser;4;What is a good alternative for spinach? I have Hypothyroidism and have been told by my doctor to avoid raw spinach and kale... so what would be a better alternative?

f9b0562f-3042-4143-88b3-0c59938c52d0;beccalynn;5;This was soooo good! My husband loved it and our young girls really liked it too. He's already asked me to make it again soon.
f9b0562f-3042-4143-88b3-0c59938c52d0;mayrie;5;My husband loved it. I only used one mashed garlic clove. Fresh dill. It was amazing. Served over rice.
f9b0562f-3042-4143-88b3-0c59938c52d0;kelly;5;Followed recipe exactly, except that I used preserved lemons. Tasted great! Will make again. Very easy to make.
f9b0562f-3042-4143-88b3-0c59938c52d0;elizabethjones;5;I was looking for a recipe to use the dill in my garden and I found this. It was excellent. I doubled the garlic and added more dill. I will definitely make this again, thank you for the recipe!
f9b0562f-3042-4143-88b3-0c59938c52d0;sandra;5;Really good. Made exactly as written.
f9b0562f-3042-4143-88b3-0c59938c52d0;sara;5;I used skinless chicken thighs and marinated them in garlic, lemon juice,olive oil and salt and pepper for about an hour. I caramelized the onions to add depth to the flavors of the dish. I also added about 3 tablespoons of dill and covered the chicken while it simmered. Such a beautifully simple dish. I served the chicken with a fennel, cucumber and caper salad. Perfect for those hot Australian summer nights.
f9b0562f-3042-4143-88b3-0c59938c52d0;janec;4;I think this is a good base for an amazing recipe but it was a little bit bland as is. But I did use no salt added broth so that may be part of it. I added extra onion and dill and garnished with a few capers. The longer the sauce sits, the more flavorful it becomes. I also put a splash of white wine in to deglaze the onions and garlic. This is a very good healthy recipe and I will definitely make it again with a few adjustments. I served it with asparagus and brown rice.
f9b0562f-3042-4143-88b3-0c59938c52d0;michelleurben;5;I've made this a number of times and made it for a wide range of people, ranging from the pickiest of eaters to ones who eat everything. It is simply THE BEST recipe I've ever had and low calories and fat. Tasting it you would never know. It's also an excellent and extremely versatile recipe. Instead of dill, I've done capers and viola its Chicken Picatta! Sometimes I add a tad more flour for a thicker sauce. Sometimes I'm in the mood for more lemon or garlic. I've also added mushrooms. So for whatever your tastes are, it truly is something delicious!!!
f9b0562f-3042-4143-88b3-0c59938c52d0;anna;5;I made this today and it was amazing I roasted brocile with mine
f9b0562f-3042-4143-88b3-0c59938c52d0;faithpascua;5;Instead of fresh dill i used 1 Tbsp of dill weed and twice the amount of garlic. I have a house of picky eaters anf not one complaint! I served this with garlic seasonef buttered corn and olive oil garlic pasta.

Anyone thinking of trying this recipe I would recommend marinating the chicken with garlic,zest and juice of 1 lemon dill and salt and pepper. I left it to marinade for a few hours than I cooked the chicken in a little oil and followed the recipe as stated I used the marinade juices and cooked that in the sauce with the chicken. I served my dish with roast potatoes..rice and pan fried the asparagus with mangetout in a little oil which I seasoned with salt and pepper.

f9b0562f-3042-4143-88b3-0c59938c52d0;linacollier;5;I'll be coming back to this soon. I love the taste of dill, although I will hold back a little on the next prep because it can add a coating that isn't always pleasant. The taste didn't seem to transfer well to the chicken breast, however, even when reapplied to the sauce. Caramelize your onions for sure. Served with: brown rice, cauliflower florets Pros: Easy to make, taste is great. Cons: Chicken seemed a little bland.

a07a9464-f182-43bb-9593-16c6e368a50f;katie;5;As a Mom and also an RD myself, I give this 5 stars! First off - it was simple! And second, absolutely delish. I followed exact directions (time / temp wise) and the chicken couldn't have been more moist or veggies cooked more to perfection. Whether you want to add a bunch of fixings to this or not, it was delish just as is! But for me - it's always guac , plain Greek yogurt, fresh salsa and a squeeze of lime :) Enjoy!

So the second time I followed the advice of some of the reviewers and let the mixture sit to absorb the liquid more before I divided them up and baked them. That seemed to do the trick!
1566fbfd-4208-4e1c-819c-cbecda421d89;vickim;2;"Pretty darn dry. I so wanted to love these. Maybe eating with syrup, yogurt and fruit, like one reviewer said, would help bring moisture back in. I think i will make in a ""bar"" shape next time."
1566fbfd-4208-4e1c-819c-cbecda421d89;snslandgyrlgmailcom;1;These turned out dry and made my family members gag. What did I do wrong? Maybe I just cursed myself by making a double batch off the bat?
1566fbfd-4208-4e1c-819c-cbecda421d89;donnamacomber;5;My husband is pre-diabetic so make these a lot BUT I have changed the recipe a bit. I use less milk, & more peanut butter. I also use Splenda brown sugar. I am going to let them soak in the batter a bit longer next time. I add chocolate chips to the top of the ones I eat! Even with less milk they make a real mess of the muffin pan so you can use paper muffin cup liners. But they are very tasty if you are a peanut butter lover....especially with more peanut butter.
1566fbfd-4208-4e1c-819c-cbecda421d89;dianebaileycollins;5;I used lactose free milk and substituted powdered sugar free vanilla creamer + 1 tsp of molasses for the brown sugar. I also made 6 large muffins instead of 12 regular, so I baked at 350 for same time. Mine are awesome. Oh yeah, raisins work great instead of chocolate chips! Thanks!
1566fbfd-4208-4e1c-819c-cbecda421d89;shalenaali;3;Mine was burnt a little, maybe I left it too long. I added 1 chocolate chip to the top of each muffin like a garnish. The muffin tasted ok, I would have one and a half to feel full.
1566fbfd-4208-4e1c-819c-cbecda421d89;janetaylor;5;Have not made these yet but they look awesome. Has anyone substituted raisins for the chocolate chips? Love oatmeal raisin cookies and with PB YUM!
1566fbfd-4208-4e1c-819c-cbecda421d89;tcosta2;4;"Be warned, this does not look like a ""batter"" as the rolled oats don't soak up the liquid right away--as you would expect--but they are tasty. I let the mixture sit for about 5 minutes and think it helped in scooping it into the tin. I love chocolate, but the chips were a bit distracting and not really breakfast-y. I will make them again, but I might try a teaspoon of jam dropped in with the peanut butter and leave out the chocolate chips."
1566fbfd-4208-4e1c-819c-cbecda421d89;kfarelli;5;These look amazing and I can't wait to try them. Love that they use natural peanut butter as most recipes do not. Do you recommend quick 1- minute oats or slow cook oats? Or steel cut? Thank you!
41b6bfe7-c809-45d4-806c-1192a038a15d;markanthonykirwan;1;Not great, I found they just fell apart during cooking. High heat, Medium heat low heat, doesn't matter, they fell apart regardless and they're a very soggy pancake. More of a banana omelette.
41b6bfe7-c809-45d4-806c-1192a038a15d;suebendelneorrcom;5;Love love love these. I don't even add syrup I just eat them dry with a fork, they're that sweet. Amazingly simple and healthy!

41b6bfe7-c809-45d4-806c-1192a038a15d;cutiepatootie;5;These pancakes are a lot like crepes so that's how I made them. I made a blintz style filling with strawberries, Greek yogurt, and sugar free pancake syrup. They came out perfectly!
41b6bfe7-c809-45d4-806c-1192a038a15d;mlmordue;4;Weight Watchers has actually been raving about this recipe for over a year. I find that without flour they have the texture more of a crepe. I add 2 T quinoa flour plus 1/4 t baking powder, or Klondike All Purpose Baking mix, and then I get very nice pancakes.
680069b2-7890-4c9b-845a-e0a5f02619d6;dawnansuininolte;5;This dish was fantastic! It reminded me of escarole soup with the little meatballs! I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth as that’s all I had. I added a few bay leaves. My husband who is a meat and potato guy, loved it. Will definitely be adding this to our rotation. Thank you!
680069b2-7890-4c9b-845a-e0a5f02619d6;mirandaandrews;5;I used canned beans, and boneless, skinless chicken breasts. First time I made it, it came out kinda bland, but the flavors developed and tasted delicious 2nd day. Second time I made this, I cooked the chicken and vegetables a day in advance, then reheated 2nd day and added the canned beans, kale, lemon and salt/pepper. Came out much better the 2nd time. I appreciate the simplicity of the recipe, and that it’s light and healthy.
680069b2-7890-4c9b-845a-e0a5f02619d6;lynn;4;Pretty easy to put together. I used boneless, skinless chicken breast cooked them with carrot, garlic powder and onion. Waiting for them to cool. Also added a bit of celery into the crockpot and instead of parmesan rind I just sprinkled in parmesan cheese. Everything else is in crockpot starting to cook. Will shred and add chicken shortly. Then kale later. I will give better rating after it's done and we try it.QUESTION Would this recipe be considered Heart healthy?
680069b2-7890-4c9b-845a-e0a5f02619d6;drehrlenmeyer;5;I used a can of northern beans and 1 pound of chicken thighs. I also used fresh rosemary from the garden, and did not feel it needed more salt. It was delicious! I have one question - how in the world is this 500 calories per serving? My calculations do not even come close.

I did shred the chicken a bit too much (I learned a trick to shred in my KitchenAid mixer but shredded a bit too long) and it kind of ended up mush, but I really enjoyed the flavor, I did need to add a bit more salt."
680069b2-7890-4c9b-845a-e0a5f02619d6;krisp4;4;I enjoyed this recipe. Very easy to make. I used canned beans and boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of bone in. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and added a little salt at the end. Very good.
680069b2-7890-4c9b-845a-e0a5f02619d6;themuffinsrgood;1;Cooking dry beans in a slow cooker is not recommended by FDA because they don't get hot enough to kill the toxins in the beans.
680069b2-7890-4c9b-845a-e0a5f02619d6;lovetocook;5;This turned out to be the best soup I’ve ever made! So delicious! I did not use a slow cooker or dry beans. 2 cans of beans in stead. I cooked the breasts in the broth with some onion and carrots, then discarded veggies. Added fresh veggies and cooked until tender while I shredded chicken. Added beans and chicken. I added a little water too because my broth was a bit rich. I forgot the lemon juice and didn’t have a parm rind so added a spoonful of parm when served. It was just so delicious! I will try slow cooker next time, it’s just not my go to kitchen tool.
680069b2-7890-4c9b-845a-e0a5f02619d6;rhonda;3;Not enough salt and seasoning. Really lacks depth
680069b2-7890-4c9b-845a-e0a5f02619d6;cathlete;4;This recipe is simple and delicious. To amp up the flavor of the soup just a bit, I added a bay leaf, some fresh thyme, 1 tsp. kosher salt, a few peppercorns, three large cloves of (minced) garlic, two (sliced) stalks of celery, and a 15 oz. can of (drained) diced tomatoes. The recipe yielded approximately four yummy quarts. Thank you!
680069b2-7890-4c9b-845a-e0a5f02619d6;andrewsinger;3;Easy to make but bland. I like natural flavors and don’t like to over spice my food, but this needed help. It needed more rosemary, more salt, and lacked a bit more of a punch. I had a feeling it would need more than what it called for, so I added two cloves of chopped garlic - which didn’t do much. I also used a hand blender to purée some of the stew as we like when it has that texture. We ended up drizzling some truffle oil on it - which we liked. Look, it’s ok and it’s easy, but it’s not “wow! I have to make that again”.
680069b2-7890-4c9b-845a-e0a5f02619d6;valerieannsorensen;5;What do they mean by “soaked” beans? Are you supposed to soak them overnight or just rinse them? Seems overkill to soak them overnight and then slow cook for 7 hours. Also would be more than 15 minutes prep.
680069b2-7890-4c9b-845a-e0a5f02619d6;hello;3;This was horribly bland. I had to add a lot of salt and ultimately season it with these and oregano. The rosemary cabt carry this dish by itself. I won't make again. it was not comforting or savory. at all.

ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;tuhmannmailcom;5;A keeper! This one was a hit with the whole family. I broke the rules & used the dregs of a bag of Raisin Bran for the bran rather than unprocessed bran. To compensate for the cereal’s added sugar, I decreased brown sugar to 1/2 cup & found the muffins to still be on the sweet side (would decrease to 1/3 c brown sugar next time). To make them school friendly I also added raisins instead of choc chips & swapped pumpkin seeds for the walnuts. Fantastic! Thanks Eating Well!!
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;pat;5;Fantastic
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;juanimahiatt;5;First, I'm going to save someone the trouble by learning from my (huge) mistake. You can NOT use psyllium husk instead of wheat bran. It soaked up ALL of the liquid so it was one big mass. I added another 1.5 cups of cashew milk and it was scoopable. They actually taste good, but they're like chewy cheese bread balls in texture. Then I discovered I had oat bran!2nd batch: We're gluten and dairy free so I used all-purpose gluten free flour, cashew milk with 1 Tbl of ACV, coconut sugar, oat bran, and all applesauce for the oil. These were so delicious and the perfect muffin texture, and 182 calories. Thank you!
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;rbickel6;5;This recipe is wonderful. The muffins come out PERFECT and beautiful and taste delicious. The only thing is I might add a touch more salt next time.
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;dmitry;5;Nice!
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;annie;5;Hubby and I loved this recipe. I don’t always follow recipes to a T because I want to use up what I have on hand. So I used the forbidden All-Bran Cereal (2 cups), 1 cup milk kefir and 1 cup milk. Added a half cup of shredded coconut (non-sweetened). It was so good!!!
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;frenchy13;4;Taste was perfect. Cut down sugar,still sweet enough. They were just a little plain with walnuts. I believe they need some type of fruits (I would say blueberries) to be perfect. But a good recipe overall.
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;alicia156;5;These muffins are delicious!! The calories listed didn't match my fitness pal though, they are higher than 200. I reduced sugar to 1/2, used 1 egg and 2 whites and used half applesauce in place of half the oil amount and even with those reductions mine are 193 each. Next time I'm going to make 14/15 smaller muffins to get them down to around 150 calories. They are really yummy thanks so much for sharing the recipe :) my kids love banana chocolate chip but don't like bran so these are peerrrrrrfect!
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;kayla;5;I have made this recipe twice in the past five days. My mom and boyfriend devoured them even though they are on the healthier side of the scale. The second time I made them I substituted organic unsweetened applesauce in place of the canola oil. You cannot tell the difference. I also added raisins, and shredded coconut to a few to add a little variation. Either way, I think they are fabulous as is or with some added bonuses. This recipe is a keeper. Try it!
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;scdemjen;5;Made these yesterday, they were GREAT. Will definitely make these again. I even messed up and added 1 1/2 teaspoons of Baking Soda and Baking powder instead of 1/2 as recipe calls for. They were still really, really good. I will make this again and this time will use sugar substitute in stead of Brown Sugar.
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;meg;5;This recipe was amazing. Light, moist muffins! The addition of the choc chips meant just the right amount of sweetness for a breakfast muffin!!
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;cricket;5;I soaked the bran in almond milk mixed with apple cider vinegar, used 1 egg and 2 egg whites, 1/2 oil and 1/2 apple sauce, whole wheat pastry flour instead of whole wheat. And sifted all my dry ingredients. My changes reduced the calories to 150 and the fat to less than 2 grams per muffin!
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;carolb;5;I loved this recipe! I actually did use bran cereal (All-Bran Buds) because a) they were in the cupboard, b) the nearest grocery store is 20 miles away, and c) I didn't see the recipe note about NOT substituting bran cereal 'til after they were in the oven! Didn't have choc. chips, but I did have raisins, so added them. Perfect.
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;raisinhell91;4;Great flavor but came out a bit dry.
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;angela;5;I also left out the chips and the muffins were not as sweet as I would have liked. I will add extra sugar if I don't add the chips next time. I also added much more cinnamon than called for and a little bit of apple sauce. The muffins were light and moist. I will definitely make these again.
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;jamiebales;5;Great recipe! Haven't tried choc chips, but have added blueberries & walnuts. Make often. Delish!
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;krista;5;I made a few changes which made these vegan (I cannot have eggs or dairy). I substituted 2 tbs ground chia seeds soaked 6tbs water for the eggs. I used almond milk with apple cider vinegar for the buttermilk. And olive oil for the canola oil. I did not use the chocolate chips or nuts. They were delicious!
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;aliciak;5;Delicious! The muffin cups were full like description said they would be. I added dark chocolate chips and the walnuts right into mix.
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;mkskitchen;5;This recipe is easy and the results are fabulous. These muffins have a lovely light texture and with less oil still taste well rounded. I don't like chocolate chips in my breakfast muffin I substituted 3/4 cup chopped walnuts and 1/2 cup coconut flakes. i had a bit of orange zest handy so I added it to make a healthy version if a morning glory muffin.

ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;theresafries;5;Excellent. I didn't have bran so I used 1/2 cup ground flax chia blend and 1/2 cup hemp seeds. Worked fine. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband loved them which really surprised me and at 154 calories (according to my recipe calculator) I'm thrilled! I will be making these every week.

It isn't fair to change verything in a recipe and then leave a commnet. Better to say...I made this new recipe...it's awesome, or, it's gross!!
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;laurastemmler;5;An awesome staple and freezes wellI make this recipe as is with the chocolate chips. These muffins are delish and I've made them 3 or 4 times now. I keep coming back to this recipe. They freeze well also. I microwave them after a day or two or after I freeze them to make the full flavor shine through. Great for breakfast or a snack. Very filling and very healthy. Pros: great for adults and kids, great for breakfast or snack
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;mscolivia;5;These muffins are tops!Substituted buttermilk for almond milk substituted vanilla extract for almond extract. Added 1/2 cup of shredded coconut. Used safflower oil instead of canola used soy flour instead of all purpose flour. The bananas, walnuts, and chocolate chips make these muffins taste like a naughty treat. But, the whole wheat flour and wheat bran provides a healthier alternative to regular muffins. These are my go to muffins when I get a craving for a sweet snack.Pros: Moist, substantial, hearty, and deliciousCons: None
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;durangokid;5;Healthy and delicious To make these great muffins even better, I doubled the recipe and used 2c. whole wheat flour and 1c. of quinoa flour. Instead of oil, I substituted the same amt. of crunchy peanut butter. I used mini chocolate chips so that they wouldn't sink to the bottom. I doubled the amt. of walnuts for their healthy oils and protein. I bake these in muffin top pans so that I can freeze them and then just pop them in the toaster for a fresh, hot breakfast. Pros: a light muffin w/ fiber and protein
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;cdel97;5;Simple! very good muffins! I didn't add choc chips, but the walnuts in them added a nice crunch! I also sprinkled some oat on top and drizzled some honey over that before baking and this added a bit more sweetness--and made them look extra pretty! Pros: Moist
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;lstripes;5;Absolutely delicious!I modified the recipe by adding less sugar and added a cup of raisins, 1 cup shredded zucchini, 1/4 cup ground flax seeds, and 1 tsp ginger. I doubled the quantity of vanilla and cinnamon. They came out superb! Next time I plan to substitute some of the oil with applesauce and add mulberries and orange zest. This is an excellent recipe because it provides the flexibility to add your own flair. Cheers!Pros: moist, healthy and filling!
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;newbiebreadmaker;5;Very versatile recipe I did not have wheat bran so I used wheat germ instead. I changed the 3/4 cup plain flour to 1/2 cup white pastry flour and 1/4 cup ground flaxseed. I replaced 1/2 cup of wholewheat flour with half cup of ground oats and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. The muffins were very soft and fluffy and still tasted sweet enough.
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;natda;5;I changed this recipe up a bit, in order to use up some canned pumpkin in my fridge.I doubled the recipe using three eggs, 2 cups of pumpkin, 1/3 cup oil, 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips, 1/2 chopped dates and about 1/4 cup crushed flax seeds. They turned out great and freeze very well.
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;lkohman;5;Very Good! I didn't have any wheat bran, so I used oat bran instead.
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;margaret;5;These are wonderful! With a bowl of fresh fruit, it's a perfect breakfast! This recipe is a definitely a do again!
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;mycathatesme;5;I really like these muffins, but I do think they need an extra something to balance the bran flavor. If you like a more earthy taste, than I think these are fine the way they are. But, personally, I prefer a stronger fruit flavor, so I add a little more banana, cinnamon, and a pinch of nutmeg. I have made these quite a few times, and I think they are a great base to toy with. I definitely think the chocolate kicks these babies up a notch. I've also tried it with Nutella (YUM!) by filling the cupcake cups half way with batter, piping a layer of Nutella, and then pouring more batter until the cup is full. I really like that version. I am making them again this weekend, but I'm going to try substituting the pumpkin for the banana. Overall, I think these are a great, fast, healthy breakfast, but don't be discouraged if they don't win you over the first time around. Play with the flavors a little bit, because the convenience of such a quick, health-conscience breakfast, makes it worth the effort.
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;elizabethkroberts;5;Love these muffins. They make the perfect breakfast on the run. Especially for my husband who refuses to get up with enough time to have breakfast. I just freeze them then defrost the morning of so we have breakfast on the go. They are just the right combination of sweet and soft/moist muffins! Will make over and over again.
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;clc1;5;This is the best bran muffin I have EVER had! I have another recipe for Banana Bran Muffins that uses bran cereal. I had remembered it as good, so made it last week when I couldn't find this recipe (and didn't have my computer available). It really didn't compare to this recipe... I'm going back to this! I usually add raisins instead of chocolate chips, to keep the fat and sugar down and add more fiber and iron. I always put 3 bananas even if they are large and make more than a cup. Always moist and yummy! I freeze half to keep them fresh for later in the week. Makes a great breakfast to look forward to!
ce7f159f-bc1e-4cfd-a5f9-b7ac1bc93781;erinoroke;5;I reduced the brown sugar a tad, but otherwise made these as written, and they turned out great--muffin tops included! Even reducing the sugar these were plenty sweet. Could maybe even go down to 1/2 cup in my opinion.

986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;cheriw;5;Made this with Boniotos instead (white sweet potatoes) and this recipe didn’t disappoint! Also used thighs and drumsticks (removed skin from both). Cooking time was about 34 total minutes and it was a hit with the whole family! Served a pear Gorgonzola side salad to round out the meal. There’s one serving left and the two teens are arguing over who gets the left overs (that never happens). Love when recipes are as easy and delicious as they seem!!
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;viktoriya;4;awesome!
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;fit123;5;Yummy! I couldn’t decide between the Dijon mustard and the grainy mustard so I used half-and-half. I tossed the sweet potato with a yellow onion an apple and about a tsp of chopped garlic and bit of the marinade. With 10 minutes left I added in a handful of cherry tomatoes. 30 minutes was perfect for boneless thighs. Delicious! Chicken was flavourful, juicy & tender.
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;jstraiton;5;So quick, easy, and delicious!! And my picky husband liked it too! Good on the second day also!
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;shalena;4;I used boneless chicken thighs. Didn't have wholegrain mustard so I used French's honey mustard. Added some grated ginger to the marinade as well as the sweet potatoes. I also added one white potato and a handful of green peppers. For my salad, I added some kale, tomato, a date an some parsley. Everything tasted delicious. However, it was not very filling. My sweet potatoes finished quickly and I had to look for another side to go with the chicken. Does healthy mean still hungry?
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;scarlettsahota;5;Super easy, tastes amazing, highly recommend!
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;lynnjohnsonpesta;4;This was very good but I didn't have thighs and I used chicken tenders. I overcooked the chicken but I would make again using thighs. I liked how easy it was.
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;lh;5;Easy to make, readily available ingredients and very tasty. I make this often and since there is just me and my husband left-overs are great as well.
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;stevendaly;5;Added Brussel sprouts to it only thing I changed. Easy meal to make.
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;brushjl;5;Great recipe, easy and tasty. I can't stand sweet potatoes so.used regular russet and they were outstanding. I also.doubled cooking time, turning.down the oven to.350 after 45 degrees, and then roasted for another 45 minutes.
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;krystena;5;This is the third time that my family has had this recipe and it is absolutely phenomenally delicious. I have doubled it each time I made it. I also substituted yellow sweet onion instead of red onion, because I find it compliments the sweet potatos better. The flavor is so delicious and the chicken is tender and juicy, and the vegetables are fork tender with wonderful peppery flavor. We absolutely love this.
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;barb;5;So easy to make! I am trying to cut back on salt and this recipe is wonderful. With the herbs and sauce on the chicken the tastes are wonderful and you don't need any extra salt.
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;jen;1;Will not make again! Did not like the flavor
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;kathymagiorkinosbohs;5;Delicious with beautiful herby aroma from the fresh tyme. So easy to make.
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;reneekrystal;3;I like the potatoes and onions. It was good. The flavor on the chicken wasn’t really for me. I wiped off most of the mixture. I also used boneless skinless chicken breast.
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;elena;5;I love this recipe. I've made it a bunch of times. I just calculated the points for Weight Watchers and I'm so happy again. I'm going to make this tomorrow!
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;leesaw83;5;The chicken was great and my family loved it! I am trying to cook at home more often and I have been trying different recipes. I will definitely be making this again.
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;steph;4;The chicken was delicious!! I used dried oregano because I didn't have thyme. I thin k the sauce quantity is a little small if you do the top and bottom of the chicken though
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;neehmiasafonso;5;Made this recipe last night, came out amazing. The onions looked and tasted caramelized with light seasoning. i cut my chicken in thinner halves and took 35-40 min to cook. i recommend the whole grain mustard, soooo goooddd
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;melissafebinger;5;I loved the way the chicken tasted. This is the best recipe for chicken that I have made - I didn't make the sweet potatoes with it, but the chicken was amazing
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;lavinialahreselatham;5;This recipe is absolutely delicious! I overcooked the chicken breasts by accident because I was working out at the same time plus I didn't have a thermometer to check the inside temperature of the chicken however our roasted sweet potatoes came out soooo good!! The morning after, I used the sweet potatoes with my scrambled eggs and it was literally amazing. I'll definitely be using this recipe again!
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;vsteinmstc2002;5;Excellent flavor and texture. Good mix of colors makes excellent presentation. I used chicken breasts and they were moist and savory.
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;becky;4;Can I make this using boneless chicken breast? What changes (if any) do I need to make then? Want to make this tonight.
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;aliceshinaberry;5;I cooked this in a crock pot, and it's so delicious.
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;dawn;3;I followed the directions exactly and thought the flavor of the chicken was too strong. I did really enjoy the sweet potatoes and onions. However my daughter and my husband didn't like the dish at all.
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;zimmernb;5;Wonderful Fall comfort food. Doubled the sauce and the amounts of olive oil. Amazing how such a simple and easy to prepare dish came out so tasty. My new favorite for chicken!
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;laney;5;Great fall dish! The whole family loved ad requested it be made again soon. I recommend using fresh thyme vs. dried thyme, it really makes a difference!
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;allencrowe;4;As I am new to Eating Well it is hard to fairly rate, but it was easy to prepare and wonderful to eat IM Adding this to my favourites to make again
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;cindyk;4;Very good! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and increased the oil for the potatoes to 2 Tbs. I also added a pinch of thyme to the oil mixture for the potatoes. My family loved this and it is a keeper. Pros: Easy, flavorful
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;lizmortonreid;5;We both loved it this recipe has made it to the keeper list!
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;taracx9;4;Simple yet deliciousWe are food geeks, & when I read the list of ingredients it seemed that this dish could be somewhat bland. I read the positive reviews & decided to go for it, as is, except adding enough olive oil to the potato & onion mixture to coat. So glad I tried this! The drippings from the chicken thighs onto the veggies really adds so much flavor. And it couldn't be easier to prepare. One note: fresh thyme is a must - dried will not add the same level of flavor. This definitely goes in the Keeper column!Pros: Easy preparation, flavorful
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;eatingwelluser;5;Great veggies and chicken My whole family loved this and it will be added to our rotation. I really liked the sweet potatoes, and I am not a big sweet potato fan. The chicken was moist and flavorful. Pros: Not that hard to make, best sweet potatoes
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;jordanhorowitz;5;One of the bestThis is one of our favorite Eating Well recipes. It is easy and the flavors are outstanding. Cooking to 165 is perfect for the thighs. Sweet potatoes (garnet yams) are nice and healthy and with red onions make for a beautiful place. Great with broccoli, broccolini, or some other bitter green to off set all the caramelized sweetness. Highly recommend.Pros: Quick, easy, tastes great, little cleanup
986f7359-aebd-4d06-97eb-f8b95a1db388;rutharriet;5;Quick, easy, very tasty Loved this. I used a sweet white onion instead of red as that's what I had. Wonderful flavor. Pros: I like to use sweet potatoes whenever possible for their slower digesting carbs. Cons: no cons here
d5327b0a-074c-4abc-87ee-f5734725648e;dothreebz;5;I used all of the ingredients, but followed none of the directions. No soaking, no food processor....just smushed everything together. Still turned out great!
d5327b0a-074c-4abc-87ee-f5734725648e;josephgravenstine;5;These are very tasty and easy to make. They are also sticky. It helps to wet your hands when rolling the balls.
d5327b0a-074c-4abc-87ee-f5734725648e;yumalicious321;4;These are good! I was a little skeptical because I've never actually had anything with dates, but I was pleasantly surprised! I used almond butter instead of peanut butter and they turned out great.
d5327b0a-074c-4abc-87ee-f5734725648e;darlenemclaughlin;5;I made these and they are so Good!
d5327b0a-074c-4abc-87ee-f5734725648e;karmynodowd;5;Tastes great. Easy to make. Perfect for on the go. I personally like them before or after a workout. I was able to buy all Ingredients from trader Joe's which made this even more convenient as well as budget friendly. Highly recommend these.

d5327b0a-074c-4abc-87ee-f5734725648e;roger;3;Looks good, will try it out and update. By the way though, really shouldn't use a nut free tag, since peanut butter is still considered a nut product and is still dangerous to anyone with a nut allergy.
d5327b0a-074c-4abc-87ee-f5734725648e;katerigemperleinschirm;5;I always have these energy bites on hand, especially if I'm running around all day. They keep in the fridge for quite a while and are perfect for a quick on-the-go snack.
d5327b0a-074c-4abc-87ee-f5734725648e;stacyfraser;5;I love these packable, peanut butter-oat energy bites. Easy to make and they hold well in the refrigerator for all week for a grab-and-go healthy snack.
