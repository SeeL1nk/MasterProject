b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;stacymartinalexander;5;It is very good. I always make a lot so that I can give half to my vegetarian daughter. I pretty much throw whatever veggies I have into it.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;ericabazan;5;It came out very sweet and flavorful. It's very concentrated so it will stretch by just adding some extra water. I make my homemade mushroom soup with this. I do want to know nutrient stats for this broth. I am dieting and use a calorie counter monitor and can not accuratly log this.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;darrensanchez;5;My wife loved ot
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;mommahen;5;I didn't change or tweak this recipe because many of the reviews advised against it. I love this broth. It was getting late and I was tired but it had not reduced enough so I put it in my slow cooker on low before I went to bed and in the morning it was done. Wow, it came out awesome, rich and robust. This is going to be my go to for all my soups now, especially my fall squash and pumpkin. Thanks for sharing it.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;harietbrown;4;I came across this recipe by chance while searching for the perfect broth to make for our neighbors across the street. The husband, Christopher, is a big soup guy, so says his wife. Well, needless to say, the pressure was on! When I saw this recipe I thought, “how could I pass up on what is potentially the WORLD’S best vegetable broth??” Now, I know Jim’s a big meat guy too, really huge in fact. That family may as well have a fridge AND freezer made of meat with how much he’s hauling home. But I didn’t let that deter me. The other reviews let me know the ins and outs of how to spice things up a bit (thanks all!), even after the whopping SIX whole peppercorns. I first read as six bay leaves, jeez what a mistake that would have been. A half hour into simmering and my two boys mouths were watering while we waited. In the end it was a great broth, although Christopher and Sherry never made it over to try it themselves. Added little tortellini’s for the kids.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;terinaheidelberg;5;Super! Loved the flavor and will make it again!
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;marydynda;5;I put a smaller amount of black pepper in, and no tomatoes . It is very good !
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;samsou22;5;I will never make vegetable broth without roasting the vegetables first. This is, hands down, the absolute best veg broth recipe. I freeze it in small mason jars and often add it to whatever I am cooking that requires liquid.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;maggy08;5;I dont use the olive oil trying to make it clean - other than that perfect. Have made this many times.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;coreoposis;5;Excellent broth recipe however, be aware, this is a labor of love. 1) I started at 1:30 pm and finished at 6:30 pm. Don't even think of using a crockpot. Plan accordingly 2) The end result is a flavorful liquid. It's not intense because it's not full of salt like the box and can versions are. 3) Make sure you cut your veggies in uniform sizes so they take the same time to roast.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;tammybrideau;5;Outstanding! thank you for this recipe it's a game changer for me now.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;rongoings;5;added red cabbage
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;lee;5;"Excellent recipe. I freeze the broth in jumbo muffin tins, with jumbo muffin silicone inserts; when frozen, the cubes (6 oz) pop right out of the inserts. I use 2 tins (12 inserts) so that I can freeze more at one time. I wrap them in cling type plastic wrap, then put them in freezer bags; they keep for months with no problems."
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;janet;5;Lotta chopping, but worth it!! and roasting the veggies beforehand was the key, I think. I added a couple of parsnips, a bunch of fresh green beans, and an extra clove of garlic (which I added to the roasting veggies.) The tomatoes were from my garden. I also added 1 tsp of salt. That's all!! It's a winner!! And I'm glad I found it, because my beautiful granddaughter is a vegetarian, and will enjoy this more than the silly frozen veggie patties I have had to serve her. Yay!!
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;debralussier;5;Yes. Absolutely delicious!
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;chickinstew;4;We sorta use this recipe. We save all our vegetable clippings in a ziplock bag in the freezer and every so often we'll follow the roasting directions in this recipe. It's a great method and the broth is delicious. Make enough so you can freeze the leftovers.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;eilidh;5;Was sooooo good!! Will make it again!!
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;eileenlavoie;5;I made this exactly the way it says, absolutely delicious! The best vegetable broth ever.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;ldmeyer;4;I add bay leaves, garlic and cloves, in a crockpot on low for 16-18 hours. Strain it and fill glass jars about 4/5 full and freeze, it keeps quite well.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;melvinkjoshlin;3;Didn't use cloves or turnips added broccoli,cilantro,0nion & garlic powder and tumeric
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;lindanj;5;So I made a couple of adjustments. :) First, I roasted an entire bulb of garlic before adding it to the water and roasted vegetables. After I reduced the broth, and this takes many hours, I puréed half of the veggies in my Vitamix blender. That gives the broth a little more substance.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;trixyinaz;5;"Loved it. I was not sure how all these veggies were going to fit in my giant pot, but after roasting them, they shrunk and fit perfectly with room to spare in the pot. I doubled the recipe because I was using some of this broth to make Crushed Lentil Soup - Lebanese style and I wanted leftovers to keep in the freezer. I juice fast and like having something hot to sip on and this broth hit the spot.After I strained the broth, I didn't want to just toss the veggies (I'm fasting and wouldn't be eating them) and ""waste"" the juice/broth that was in them so I decided to run them through my juicer to ""squeeze out"" the broth. Got an extra 7 cups of broth. YUMMY!!! BTW, My husband LOVED the crushed lentil soup so I will definitely continue using this broth as its base. Thanks for a great broth. The only thing I added was a bit of salt. Will make again. Thanks!"
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;dianegruppuso;5;This is wonderful and in my opinion the best vegetable stock is make with roasted vegetables. You can be creative and add your favorite herbs toward the end of roasting too (I love a little rosemary in mine). I like to cook mine down a little further than half for more richness but it's not necessary,
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;surusso;5;"I'm not sure about it being ""The World's Best"", but it was very good. I used fresh veggies from the garden, and it was loaded with flavor. Thank you for the recipe!"
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;rawwarrior;5;Added potatoes instead of turnips. Yummy
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;dfreed02;5;This is the best broth recipe ever. The flavor is so good you can just drink it and it's an awesome base for any recipe...if you are cleansing or dieting this should be on your list as a pick me up. Ironstone garlic with the other veggies. You can eat the veggies cold on salad, as an addition to pasta or rice...or the best is puréed as a low cal gravy!!!! This is in my top ten recipes! I consider onions, carrots, and celery the Trinity of cooking unless I go NOLA then it's onions, peppers and celery!
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;lizblaise;5;So it's a lot of time to make this, but it was delicious. I modified the recipe using veggies on hand (no turnips but asparagus, broccoli). After it straining I pureed the veggie chunks and added them back to the broth with black beans, corn (fresh off the cob)and a can of diced tomatoes (drained). The result was a delicious creamy all veggie soup that my family loved. Served with crusty baguette and we are all set.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;pattimac2000;5;tried it twice, without the turnip... made a huge batch the second time, canned it with my pressure cooker in quart jars. use it for rice and soups, or when ever I need broth. great recipe!
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;lenamay;5;This stock was excellent and easy to make. After stock cooked down, I took vegetables out and pureed in my food processor. I added back in the pureed vegetables, added a can of diced tomatoes with garlic and basil, some kale and white beans and a dash of red pepper flakes. This made a really great soup. Excellent and thanks for sharing.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;kimberly;4;Really good stock! This is a HUGE recipe though - I do a lot of cooking, and I do not have a pot big enough for this stock! I used both of my soup pots, and that worked. It is an awful lot of shopping and chopping and peeling for a couple of ice cube trays of stock in the end, and I think the veggie puree will take longer to use up than the stock itself. Next time I would use only two cloves instead of three, I would replace the green peppers with yellow or orange ones, and I would not add more turnips than called for. Overall, very healthy and tasty stuff.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;bethwheeler;5;I'm on my first day of a liquid fast using Almaded protein shakes, and they recommend drinking homemade vegetable broth to help with hunger between shakes, so I Googled and found this recipe. I started simmering this about 45 minutes ago, and couldn't wait to try it because I'm a bit hungry (mid-afternoon). The broth is already very flavorful, am eager to taste the final result! I added a can of diced tomatoes, 1 parsnip, 3 zucchini and 1 large sweet potato to what the recipe calls for. I also added lots of rosemary and garlic powder to the veggies as they roasted. To the soup pot I added minced garlic instead of whole cloves, and ground cloves instead of whole because that's what I had on hand. EDIT 2/9/2014: I added balsamic vinegar after cooking, and it gave it an amazing zing to the already delicious flavor. The veggies taste fantastic, and I'm going to puree & freeze them to add to future soups, sauces and dishes. I will use this same recipe again and again, chopping the veggies smaller and adding proteins and grains for a complete meal.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;jocelyndimarco;5;True to its name, this IS the Worlds Greatest Veg broth. I've been using this recipe for almost eight years now, in fact i very rarely make chicken stock anymore which is a blessing because this is so much easier (and cleaner) The only change I make is I like to include sweet potato. and instead of just tossing the veg in olive oil I use a mixture of olive oil and tomato paste, it gives it more richness.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;annecassens;5;Awesome, complex flavors are a perfect blend.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;meredithc;5;"I've made it twice now. I use whatever vegetables I have on hand, even rhubarb! I use this recipe as a guideline - I added ginger and tumeric, garam masala, and tumeric and left out the bay leaves the second time. Way super good! I like this recipe more than others; I think it's browning the veggies first that makes the difference."
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;dlj;5;Made this as the broth for my matzo ball soup as my vegetarian son can't eat chicken soup. The whole family loved it!
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;jqt13;5;Yum! Based on the positive reviews, I made a double batch. I didn't use any oil and roasted a half head of garlic with the vegetables. Used cilantro in place of parsley. Tastes even better the next day.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;becky;5;This made a very rich broth. I followed the recipe exactly except for using slightly less tomatoes and bell peppers, just using what I had on hand. I think the broth is much richer and more flavorful than canned, so you can get by with using less in your recipes. I used only half as much as called for in a vegetable soup recipe, and added water for the remainder. It turned out just fine. Don't let the vegetables go to waste. I puree them, and then freeze them by scooping 1/2 cup of pureed vegetables into snack size baggies. I add one of these portions anytime I make a soup, stew, or even spaghetti sauce. It gives some added flavor and nutrition.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;liuzard9715;5;Loved this broth! I have always made my own chicken stock, but I am trying to cut out the cholesterol from meals so I opted to try to make my base for soups and rice with a vegetable base instead. I followed the recipe mostly but I did add a some garlic power and additional garlic cloves. I did not have any cloves so I substituted with some allspice. Just a suggestion, make sure that you have atleast 4 & half hours to spend on this because it takes over an hour to roast all of the vegetables and about 3 hours to reduce the broth down.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;laurelamanda;5;This broth is amazing. In the interest of laziness and maximum flavor, I stew the roasted vegetables with the water and other ingredients in my slow cooker for a few hours before reducing the broth. Less stove watching, but it still produces a really rich and flavorful broth.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;sylwia;4;I made this broth the other day but in a hurry didn't read that I need to roast the veggies first. So I threw them in a bot and cooked them. I am sure they come out even better than what I did when you first roast them but even just cooked this broth has amazing flavor. I just used it as a base for the Beaker's Vegetable Barley Soup and it turned out very yummy. Next time I will roast everything first though. will make again
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;scottm;5;This is my favorite vegetable broth recipe. I make this in a half portion, and then freeze for future recipes (like potato soup, etc).
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;6kitties;5;Wow, this is good! On my second batch I added celery root, brussel sprouts and broccoli. Also roasted the garlic along with the other veggies. Added a good amount of red wine to the water, too. After reduction added some porcini salt and balsamic vinegar. Used it to make a wonderful lentil soup to which I added a bit of truffle oil just before serving. Thank-you Tom! :-)
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;steflynne66;5;I am a beginner cook and I came on here looking for recipes that are low sodium that I can make for my Mom. I made this broth to use with a favorite dish of my Mom's, Potpie. She loved it. Thanks for the recipe. Will be using this one often.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;cyngamgam;5;This was delicious! It is now my go to vegetable broth. I do find it to be a little on the sweet side. I use it to cook my lentils although it does make them a tad sweet.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;hotsun;5;Finally a broth that works for me! It tastes wonderful, made it with no changes. I did find it took much longer to make because my pot was too high and didn't condense quickly enough. Will definitely be making it again
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;veggiebee;4;Tasted great, but do take the time to reduce it. If you're taking the time to roast the veggies and make broth from scratch, just do the whole deal.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;ladyhkaz;5;Excellent stock. I like to make lasagna and egg rolls with the left over veggies. I use whole pasta or egg roll wrappers for the lasagna. Season the pulp separately depending what type of recipe it is.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;connelly;5;If you would like for this broth to be a bit thicker and heartier, I suggest you save the water you used to boil some pasta and use it to simmer the vegetables for this broth.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;pajamann;5;This is a rich, delicious broth and has ruined me for any other vegetable broth. It freezes well, too. Make plenty and freeze some since it is a bit time-consuming (but well worth the effort!). Thanks so much for sharing!
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;oneolddawg;4;Wonderful vegetable broth. Took it a step further....leave all the veggies in, add 1/2 cup of barley, 1 cup water, 1 cup kidney beans. A great vegetarian vegetable soup....
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;icook;5;Very good! The leftover veggies were adictive with a little bit of salt added
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;cmnbbox;5;very good
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;gmaof16;5;Excellent! Are the turnips used to kind of replace potatoes? Also I think if I can find them, Rutabaga would be good to add, or to replace the turnips with. They are a bit sweeter than turnips. Also if you puree the vegetables , they make a great addition to meatloaf or meatballs.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;glutenfreevegme;5;this recipe is so great. there are no good vegetable broths on the market that don't include some form of gluten, and being a vegetarian, good broth is crucial to so many recipes. this one is not only delicious on its own but versitile, adding complexity and depth to everything from soups, curries, quinoa, and risotto! so good. regardless of what others said this was not difficult considering the servings yeilded and the ease of freezing for later use. i like lots of garlic so i add 3 cloves to the roasting pot in addition to the 3 original cloves. i also pureed the veggies once cool and made a pretty killer curry out of them. thank you for sharing this recipe!
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;zeezeebaker;4;Delish! I had to tweak the recipe a bit (I can't eat cooked carrots and didn't have any turnips), but it still came out well. I used the broth to make Spicy African Yam Soup (from this site). It was great. I have a number of food intolerances, and making my own broth will give me so many more cooking options. Yay!
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;oinkette;5;The title says it all! I made this broth while on a juice/liquid fast and it was absolutely wonderful. I liked it so much, I made it even after my fast was over.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;michellerogers;5;Pretty tasty and easy to make. For the vegans who cannot due garlic or onion due to religous beliefs add other hearety veggies.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;carie;5;It was extra work, but totally worth it! Smelled great while it was cooking! When it cooled down I kept filling up ice cube trays with it and freezing small portions so I can drop one into cube easily into a pot and use it in small doses! I would make again in a heartbeat!
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;amymeri;4;A lot of work but delicious.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;slj6;5;Another 10 for taste, ease, cost, and fat/sodium control. Made 6 2c. containers for the freezer. I had no turnips on hand though. I also subbed the green pepper for a red, and added an additional 1/2 of a red onion, 3 cloves of smashed garlic, 2 bay leaves and some thyme as well...used up what I had. I slow simmereed this for hours and saved the veggies at the end. I ended up putting these veggies through my food processor for a few seconds and adding this wonderful roasted puree to my pot of chicken soup for extra flavor and veggie value...Wonderful! Thanks!
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;sarahjo;5;This IS the World's Greatest Vegetable Broth. Totally saved my behind this week as I'm low on cash and can't afford boxed/canned organic broth. I did cheat a bit and used two week's worth of trimmings (I throw my trimmings in ziploc bags, then use them in the recipe for the broth later) from vegetables in with a small amount of the called for vegetables to fill in what I needed for the broth and I did use one drained can of organic diced tomatoes only because I could not afford fresh tomatoes. That's a cheap way to really use the most out of the produce you buy and really get a super flavorful broth. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe--this was an absolute lifesaver for me. Next time, I'll try this with a few pieces of chicken wings to get a homemade vegetable-chicken broth. NOTE: MAKE SURE YOU REDUCE YOUR BROTH. That's a key step. Do not skip it.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;jajireh;4;"This recipe came up on my igoogle daily rotation of recipes from this site. It caught my attention immediately, even though we are not vegetarian. It simply sounded like a hearty broth with which to cook rice, or use in a future soup/stew, etc. Well. I am VERY impressed with the hearty flavor this broth produces! It is aromatic as it simmers all day, and easy, easy to produce. I've 10 cups of broth, 8 in the freezer, and 2 for tomorrow's meal; three cups of vegetables to munch on, and three cups in the freezer for future use in a stew. Here is why I only gave it a four star: the broth is missing salt. While I understand the reason WHY no salt (allows the broth to be used in a recipe without adding additional), I would still have to add it, were I to use this as a warm drink on a chilly night (it's that good!) One last note: I added 1/2 a head of cabbage to the mix, as I had it on hand. A great addition. SUPER RECIPE, Tom!! Thank you! :D"
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;tomw;5;One user made it in a crock pot and said it was bland. The instructions say to simner it and reduce the broth by half. No wander the broth was bland, the crock pot still had all that extra liquid in it.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;nikolettet;5;"I love this recipe. I usually just roast everything but the garlic together and find it comes out great. Once I roasted small pieces of garlic and they scorched, I don't know what I was thinking! I've also roasted an entire head and it didn't burn at all, then I used the extra for a roasted garlic bread.... delish! I've used the roasted vegetables to blend up, season and make a vegan pate for crackers. I've also added cream cheese and seasoning and made a cheesey vegetable dip. Proper seasoning is what gets good results if you choose to use your left overs that way. I dabble with different herbs and seasonings each time and it always goes well. I use the broth as a base for a lot of asian soups. Its great for stock in pot pies and supurb seasoned and eaten on its own. I have given out this recipe several times and its always a crowd pleaser. The best part is that its so simple to wash the veggies, clean them, give them a rough chop and pop 'em in the oven, roast, simmer, strain and eat. Freezes well too, of course. Depending on what I'm using the broth for I sometimes add extra ingredients, more tomatoes, more onions, less turnip (NEVER omit the turnip, even if you don't like them they add an important balance and the flavor does not impart a ""turnip-y"" taste at all), halved crimini mushrooms, etc etc. This recipe is great because it seems to invite exploration. I think it truly is the World's Greatest Vegetable Broth!"
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;grayce;4;"I use this technique to make my broth. When I cook thruout the week I keep a plastic bag in the fridge filled with all the peelings & cut offs from the veggies I've used all week. This includes onion & garlic skins & all the items in the fridge that look like they're ready for vegetable heaven. If the bag doesn't look full enough I put it in the freezer until I have a ""BIG"" bag full. It never tastes exactly the same but it always tastes good. I store some of the broth in small baggies for portion control and use those for gravies & other recipes that need 1 cup of broth. The rest in a large bag for soup. A Chef taught me this."
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;staceyrudolph;5;I love that I can use up veges for my soups! I always have extra veges in the fridge, and didn't think about using them to flavor it. I don't really like eating all the veges, but the flavor is great when sauteed and strained. Mmmm!
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;murphy;3;This broth was okay. I think since I'm not a huge fan of cooked carrots and celery, that did it in for me. My boyfriend liked it a lot though.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;nancyswidas;4;I liked this soup alot. The only change I made was I didn't add turnips but I added a roast to it. Making it a beef/veg soup. I think it is rather bland so next time I will add more spices. I will make it again.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;bekkah;4;A very good broth. I used a yam instead of turnips and added 2 Thai chili peppers, but otherwise made it pretty much as described. The yam made the soup quite sweet and I had to add a considerable amount of salt to cut the sweetness. The chilis were VERY hot and made the soup quite spicy which I personally loved, though others may not. I added extra of all the spices (pepper, clove, garlic) and I think that without the chilis, I would not have liked this soup very much (I think it would have been too bland) which is why I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars. But the combination of sweet, salty and spicy made the soup quite good. I ground up the veggies the next day and mixed them with oatmeal and eggs and made a ton of veggie burgers which were delicious!
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;bakeorama;5;I made this to use for my Thanksgiving turkey stuffing. I added mushrooms because I love them. Going to chop and freeze the leftover roasted veggies to use in turkey meatloaf.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;thesanguinechef;5;Absolutely the best - adds rich flavors to recipes. Originally I made it to brine a turkey - worth the work.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;tampazeke;4;As a recently converted vegetarian I really loved this recipe too. It's richness of flavor satisfies my occassional meat tooth. I too cut back on the parsley (not a big fan). I also added a few DRIED Shitake mushrooms which gave the broth an even richer and more meaty (beefy) flavor. I know that isn't something that longterm vegetarians care about but it might be helpful to meat eaters who want to become vegetarians but need a flavorful way to wean themselves from the flavor of meat.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;vegnmom;5;I made the broth as directed. It is really quite nice - the flavor is wonderful. I'm using it as a base for a kale and white bean soup recipe elsewhere on this site. As others have mentioned the roasting vegetables create a lovely aroma. Recommended!
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;cnmcatering;5;THANKS FOR THIS RECIPE I NEEDED VEGETABLE BROTH FOR MY TURKEY BRINE. I USED THE LEFTOVER BROTH AND VEGGIES TO MAKE A POT A SOUP FOR MY KIDS.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;rltaylor;4;This veggie broth turned out great! However, I'd recommend only roasting the vegetables in the oven for about 1/2 an hour. The veggies would have been burned if I would have cooked them for over an hour as the recipe listed. (My oven is calibrated correctly).
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;marie;3;I made this in a crock pot all day and the broth came out too bland for me to eat by itself. I ended up using it for veggie pot pie which was tasty.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;jessicad;3;I didn't think this vegetable broth was as impressive as the other reviewers, it was good but... I didn't have clove but I can imagine that would be the difference between okay and great. The vegetables roasting made the house smell really good which was nice.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;barnkitty;4;Roasting the veggies gave a nice caramel color and rich flavor. No turnips or gr. peppers, but still lots of good taste.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;trooworld;4;This is very good, I made it as it was written. Make sure and reduce it down or it will not have much flavor.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;vivacleo;5;Loved it. Absolutely loved it. I'll never buy canned or boxed broth again.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;chessdilorenzo;5;Loved this! I make lots of risotto, so this is a perfect recipe for me. Also, I purée the leftover vegetables and add them to a spaghetti sauce for later meals.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;addie;5;Making this broth made my apartment smell great! It was great for risotto, when the most important thing is the broth. I made a double batch, reduced it by half, and then froze it in ice cube trays.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;sininen;5;I can't decide which is better: The smell of the roasting vegetables through the house or the taste of the broth! Very good.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;kez;5;I roasted the vegetables the night before on a spare shelf in my oven when I was making dinner. Then made the broth the following day. Used as a base for carrot and coriander soup II from this site and froze the remainder in ice cube bags. Will definitely keep this in my freezer full time. Thanks.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;carolann;5;the name of the recipe says it all. this was a very delicious broth. I basically diced my veggies pretty small to use in a stuffing later, so as much time in the oven wasnt needed overall, but I can tell you I used this broth for a goose brine http://thanksgiving.allrecipes.com/az/TrkyBrin.asp for Christmas dinner. The goose, the stuffing and the gravy (using the drippings from the goose) were eaten all on Christmas day.. no leftovers :(
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;acookfromdallas;3;This was OK. Didn't see what all the fuss was about.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;krpint;5;This made a great soup base. I put it in icecube trays to use as needed! I pureed the left over vegetables and added some milk to make a quick soup.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;sueslp;4;Great broth. I used it in a delicious minestrone soup. Richflavor and aroma. I think next time I would reduce the parsley.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;catwalk16;5;Very good, I will make this again. I froze it in ice cube trays and use them as needed, very handy and so much more healthy than the cubes.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;guanaco;5;This vegetable broth really lives up to it's name. I made a batch today, and it was by far the BEST broth I've ever tried. It took a little extra time than a normal vegetable broth does to make (due to roasting the vegetables), but the result is so rich in flavor---I can't see myself using my old broth recipe ever again. I can't wait to use this as a base for cooking legumes and rice, as well as a soup base.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;tulip22blue;5;this really is the world's greatest! I made a huge batch and it froze really well too.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;ammybug;5;What a beautiful flavour! The cloves, I think, really added something special. My only critisism might be that I could deal with a little less parsley. Thank you very much. This was great.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;carolinec;5;You simply cannot beat home-made broth. While it is rather time-consuming, there's nothing like the aroma and flavor of making it yourself. I usually omit the turnip, and green pepper, and only roast the veggies if I have time (otherwise I just pop them in the pan raw), and it still tastes fantastic. Also, I roast the bones, carcass, left-over skin and meat of a chicken or turkey, and add that to the vegetables. I simmer this gently for 2 hours, and it is fantastic.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;keeperrox;5;After straining, I added 1 can of diced tomatoes, with juice, 1 can dark red kidney beans, and 1 can Cannelini beans, and brought it back to a boil. Then I added 1 cup of Pastina shaped pasta, and cook it for 4 minutes. It made a great hearty vegetarian soup, and I got some protein in there too! Thanks Tom, for this great broth!
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;nikcook;5;really tasty, the best vegetable soup I've had. it takes alot of time but dang it's good. I used the broth to cook rice, on chicken it was all good.
b7526c6b-560b-4000-a4da-9112bcaa657a;goodkitty;5;Yum-yum! Broth is excellent, and the veggies are great tasting too! I used this stock as a base for Curried Squash Soup. Divine!

0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;brownsugar;5;Wow!! so good, I made a dip with avocado just elevated the taste .
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;camilacayvzquez;5;Pretty easy to make. I added adobo seasoning to the water, but you could add a little bit of salt or any other seasoning you like.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;shelleybeachler;5;I did not use the water system as reading a couple of reviews. I did let the plantains get black. Only fried them in vegetable oil. Didn't need to add anything to them, are sweet as candy. Oh my, these are delicious. Hubby loved them too. Will make them again.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;sarahkatherineross;5;Turned out really great, but I greatly reduced the cooking time. I do t know if my oil was too hot or what, but my first batch was black at 3 1/2 min per side. 2ish min per side seemed to work.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;elisabeth;5;I've had tostones before but I made them for the first time today. I thought they would be difficult but was pleasantly surprised by how easy and delicious they were! I didn't think to take a picture (they went fast) but they looked just like the picture. I didn't change or add a thing.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;shawnmknox;5;These were quite good. In fact, these were the best I have ever made. I appreciate the tips from others regarding the when to use, or not use water. Since I made these and served them right away I skipped that step. Also, someone commented that plantains are not a type of banana. This is not true. They are very different in taste but they are from the banana family. I totally recommend this recipe. The crunchier, the better, in my opinion. Thanks for sharing.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;dan;4;In Venezuela we ate fried platanos as an appetizer. Cut diagonal strips 2inches long by about 1/4 inch thick. Fry until the outside is crunchy and the middle is mushy. Top with cheese and they will be gone as soon as they are cool enough to eat!
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;lina;5;Simple, easy, in no time. The whole family loved it!
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;preyeokah;5;Great!
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;joanperez;4;Reduce water to 1/3 cup sprinkled liberally with garlic salt. If possible use a better brand garlic salt and never fresh garlic. BTW - old timers never used plates for flattening. They’ll use a torn piece of brown paper bag or platano press. Good luck - the garlic salt brings it to a whole new and delicious level.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;littlemama;5;As someone pointed out. It's in the beginning of the process to put in water. But if you want a little extra kick to it , add vinegar and salt to the water and let it sit for a little while before frying. And as suggested by Sanda Jz. pat dry. Make a garlic sauce on the side to dip them in. There are some recipes for garlic sauce for tostones on the web.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;ofeliagarciabarcena;5;I use yellow firm plantains instead of the green ones. They taste sweeter, crisp on the outside and creamy on the inside. Love it!
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;angelabarboza;5;Put some sazón and adobo in the water. It gives it an amazing taste.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;luzottens;5;I’m Puerto Rican and have been making these for over 40 years. It’s a staple food like potatoes for us. We do make two types of dipping sauce. One is finely diced garlic ( a lot) into olive oil and the other is mayonnaise and ketchup. I know the mayo ketchup is now found in supermarkets but we use a little mor ketchup than the store bought. Hope you tru the sauces.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;dave;4;I like the taste (and would make them again), but boy what a mess it made in my kitchen with spattered oil. My guess is that the temp only needs to be on low medium, and as someone else stated, pat off the water with a paper towel before frying the second time. Perhaps dipping in water isn't even necessary. PS - What kind of oil is recommended?
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;pjflats;5;I skipped the water also. Super easy to make. Be sure not to cut too thick. Used green plantains this time and will try yellow next time. Great with a little salt and ketchup but I’m definitely going to try to make the mayo ketchup dipping sauce at some point too. New edition to family menu for sure
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;danielespinosa;5;I've been making these quite frequently over the past year or so and there are ways to make them a bit healthier. If you have a non-stick skillet/frying pan then you can just fry them in water instead. I usually salt them after they're done and then serve with ketchup, but you could use other sauces to dip them in - like salsas, avocado, etc. Also, if you want to keep them ripe or rather prevent them from ripening too much, you can store them in the fridge up to a week or so and that will stop them from ripening too much. I like to buy them in bunches (6-10) at a time and then stick them in the crisper. Just take them out and let them sit for about 10-20 minutes before you cook them and they'll be much easier to peel and work with.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;beachgirl57;5;I followed the directions exactly. Amazing!
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;anthonywwatsonsr;5;Great add on to the main dish and taste outstanding!
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;mikeginnymd;5;Yup. This is how it's done. I feel like I'm back in the Bronx.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;connorleonpack;4;Super easy to make! You'll definitely want to research how to peel plantains if it's your first time, as they aren't as easy as a banana. The final flavor is very similar to a potato chip, very starchy. Great with ketchup for you Americans out there!
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;drewross;5;I made them according to the recipe and they came out great. From what I read elsewhere the reason for dipping them in water is to make them crisp up better.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;dave;3;I read many reviews after I made them exactly as recipe. Next time, I am going to use half butter and half oil for frying. Use black or yellow and black plantains. Cut them in thicker pieces, 1.5 inch diagonal slices. And fry 2 minutes per side. Then flattening by rolling a can over them sandwiched between wax paper. Then refry 1 min per side. Half I sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and half with garlic salt.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;bermom;3;They did not do it for me. I am not sure if I did something wrong or not. I am used to the restaurant style plantains and they are much sweeter and softer. I will keep looking. Thanks for the recipe anyway.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;darrahkarnes;5;My plantains were A LOT more ripe than the typical green ones I usually see (and know now are what you're supposed to use). I thought you bought the green ones then were supposed to let them ripen before use lol. Anyway, I fried my very ripe plantains in coconut oil, in a cast iron skillet, then sprinkled them with sea salt when they were done. They were seriously great! These came out much better than the tostones I've had at Puerto Rican restaurants and from my cousins mother. I'm not sure if it was the recipe, that I probably used more ripe plantains than the others, or that I used coconut oil instead of canola or vegetable oil, but I will absolutely make these again following this recipe. Next time I'll try green plantains because I'm sure they'll be even better!
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;chocolover;5;So easy and delicious. As a plantain beginner, I was under the impression that plantains peeled like bananas do... just a warning, they don't! I learned that the hard way!
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;grillcleaner;4;Tostones are an awesome side dish. However I first fry them then I remove from pan. Then I smash them. And tip them in a bowl of water with adobo then re fry them. It just adds more flavor.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;amcapili93;5;Super easy!! Took maybe 5 minutes to make! Next time I'm going to cut them diagonally so that you don't end up flipping and watching so many little circles. I also put garlic salt on half and truvia on the other half to make it sweet and it was really good!!
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;angiecmoore;4;I added garlic to my water and let the tostones soak for about a minute just to give a bit of flavor.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;prmom24;5;One of my familys fave! I do not think there's any of my kids that dont like tostones... My husband loves them too. My variation to the recipe is that after i peel and slice the plantain i put in water with adobo before frying , these gives them more flavor. after frying i use a tostonera to mash the toston a bit and then return to fry pan to crisp. Then just make a mix of fresh crush garlic with a bit of olive oil which i heat. We love it alone, with fried pork or chicken or just as a side with rice, beans and chicken. And by the way a plantain is not a banana, it is much larger and firm than a banana. The peel is very different too. When plantains become ripe you can slice and fry to make what is called Maduro . This is a sweet version though and you just fry once you do not refry..
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;aputler;5;Great side dish. Followed LatinaCook's directions and they turn out fantastic every time. The bottom of a small can (like 4oz, etc..) seems to be a good size to flatten a 1 inch thick slice of Plantain.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;vieraklauz;5;My first time trying Plantain - Used a very ripe Plantain (almost completely black) - fried in coconut oil - flattened only half the batch to fry again and the others remained as sliced - the flattened plantain was firmer with a dryer centre - both methods tasted very sweet - will definately make again as it satisfied my sweet tooth to easily skip dessert!
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;gypsiej;4;"Tostones in English would be ""Twice Fried Platains"" (since you are frying them twice) ""Fried Platains"" are Amarillos/Platano Frito. I never used to soak the platains before, now I do. I soak them for about 2-3 hrs in salt water. I drain the water and pat dry w/ a paper towel. They come out crispier and tastier! :) If short on time, I do not soak them."
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;walther86;4;Easy to make and a nice side dish to go with savory entrees.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;roxanehicks;5;Amazing recipe!!! make sure the plantain is very green. I love to dip mine in spicy humus yummy!
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;bessy988;4;awesome recipe, easy to follow, gave it four stars because i skipped the water step, freaked me out and don't really wanna deal with a house fire. the only thing is they did not come out crispy but that may be just my fault because i mistakenly turned down the heat on the wrong burner. will try again but besides that very nice recipe, pretty proud of myself, haven't made tostones from scratch in awhile. oh, and one more thing, i also put about a tbsp of salt and a tbsp of sugar in a cup mixed together and sprinkled them on top of the tostones as soon as i got them out the frying pan the second time, delish!! the sugar makes it even better!!
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;troyepelaar;4;Plantains are not bananas, they are related but have a much higher starch content. They should always be cooked as they don't taste good raw, green or ripe.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;katyoung;5;I just wanted to point out to those having difficulty with this recipe is that a toston is never to be made with a ripe plantain....the texture will be completely different at that point you simply slice and fry them and they are what we call maduros....always use a firm GREEN plantain and you will end up with a crispy treat with the endulgance of a fry....also follow the recipe to the T yes you can soak them before you first fry them so they do not blacken, however it will ensure a crispier toston if you dip in salted water right before the second fry...hope this helps! =)
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;doristam;5;Good stuff! Definitely let your plantains ripen fully.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;whtyegirl1;5;Yummy - Hard to mess these up
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;melissagoff;1;"well.....I totally don't know how to rate this. I want to 1st say, I've never in my life eaten plantains. So I really didn't know what to actually expect even having people give me an idea. One thing I waited until my plantains were nearly black skinned to be sweet. I followed the recipe but I used 2 plantains but left the amount of the oil and water the same. Another AR'er looked at the recipe and said she was worried about the ""dipping in the water"" then frying in oil. So I vowed I would do a few to try that way...and glad I did. They splatter so hard, so high, I was reaching for the splatter guard and said..nope. I'm not dipping anymore because it was crazy to do anymore that way. I salted the 1st few that came out and I have to say....didn't like that. And it really was just a dash of salt. Not like salting french fries. At that point I couldn't get past the salt taste. That's just me. Hubby tasted 2 & was like ""weird & interesting"" So I didn't salt anymore after that. I let 2 of my kids try that were around & they both spit it out. They didn't like them at all. While they did have a sweet taste to them. That part was interesting. I ate a few, trying to keep an open mind, but all in all. I'm now worried about wasting 4 more plantains that are ripening, because no one else will eat them in my house after this. Interesting I'll give that. But can't say that I'd go all out & make again. People who like them, will like this recipe. I just guess I'm not one of them. SO sorry."
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;isapizza;5;great they taste just like Mama would make them when we ran around the mountain in San Juan.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;sugarcookie;5;My husband is puerto rican so we make these a lot. It actually took me a few tries to get the hang of cooking them by myself b/c growing up my mom only taught me how to make the fried plantain chips for eating like popcorn. These, on the other hand are great as part of a meal. Especially with rice and beans. Our sauce is just equal parts ketchup and mayo- so it looks pink. DH also likes to soak them in water and adobo after cutting to flavor them. I like this method of flavoring. I think it makes a big difference than just sprinkling on dry adobo.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;superfifee;5;This recipe is not exclusively Puerto Rican. I am Jamaican and we make the same thing. I never put water on the plantains and it is important that you do not cut them too thick when you fry them the first time. Pick pretty, green plantains. This dish is meant to be eaten with something flavorful like fish with onions, so don't be shocked at its lack of flavor. In Jamaica we eat it with herring, mackerel or codfish. This dish is served in many island countries, as well as Latin American countries.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;beanz;5;Yum. So simple yet sooooooooo good! Best fried plantain I've had yet.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;catwhispererphd;2;Not so good. Perhaps it's just me and the fact that it's my first time making these. I'm not sure I can believe the nutritional analysis either. But when flattened they turned into messy dry starchy things and they didn't pick up the rest of the oil well- they were just a pile of mush. They looked and smelled good up until then.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;dgreenwood;4;Well I had a bit of trouble with frying, removing, flattening and then re-frying. I'm not a co-ordinated person. BUT the plantains did come out good and made a nice side to the Puerto Rican meat patties we made from here. I gave it 4 stars only because for me, it is a lot of work.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;ashleyb;4;I did not use any water. I also added garlic powder at the end too. I will definitely make again.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;thehobblinggourmet;5;My first time making my own. Very tasty. I added a few drops of agave syrup. Yum. I suppose you could use sugar or honey too. Thanks.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;worldcookingmaster;3;Uses to much oil, try not covering it completly, taste sort of like french fries
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;gerimiller;5;So good, and a nice starch alternative. The photo has the plantains sliced regularly, but I like to slice them slightly on the bias so they are longer, and they look prettier on the plate.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;mommyluvs2cook;5;My first taste of plantains and it was delicious!!! I probably used a plantain that was almost ripe because it had some black spots it just wasn't completely black. Definitely dry off the plantains after putting them in the water before you throw them in the oil. I sprinkled with salt the second they were done. What a yummy snack!!
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;joannas922;5;Yummmmyyyyyy
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;darielruiz;3;Just a few observations: 1. If you want to have a toston that is made like those in Puerto Rico you have to have green plantains (oh, and a plantain is not a banana. They are related, but are not the same. A plantain is much larger and thicker than a banana, even the plants are different). 2. The slices should be cut diagonally so the initial frying can cover the most area. 3. If you don't have a tostonera, a can or a plate can be used to squash the slice, 4. Once it is squashed it is put in salted water for at least 30 minutes, not just to prevent it from going brown, but to give the toston a very good salty taste. 5. Last you fry it until golden brown. 6. Some people make mayoketchup mix (mayonnaise mixed with ketchup) or olive oil with salt, lemon, and garlic or just sprinkle with garlic salt. Hope this has clarified some issues with the recipe.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;ktd86;5;Yummy! They brought me back to Euador where my husband and I first met. I omitted the water steps as that just sounded dangerous to me. I used plantains that were yellow with black spots to get a sweeter taste and cut them about 1 1/2 inches thick. I also followed LatinaCook's suggestion of initially frying them for a shorter period of time--about 2 minutes per side. Then I drained them on paper towels before flattening them (I think it helped to cut down on some of the grease). Then I fried them again as the recipe called, drained and salted...my daughter loves these!
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;pixelsicle;2;"It is better to put these in salted water before you fry them and only after they are dried. Also, the plantain ""smoosh"" better if they are cut at an angle, but that's just me."

0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;connie;3;This was the first time my family had tried these. I liked them but my sons did not. I think I should have chosen a plantain that was a little more ripe. They had a sour taste to them. I dunked them in ketsup.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;sweetpea;5;Very good, but not the quickest thing to make. The drinking glass worked just fine to smoosh them. I served them with Arroz con pollo and a salad, and Hubby gobbled them up.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;jennmiami;5;"Just returned from Puerto Rico where we stayed in the mountains and my children discovered their love for tostones--these are exactly right! For people looking for the sweet plantains they have eaten in restaurants, sometimes called ""maduros,"" make sure that you note that this recipe traditionally calls for green plantains and is not supposed to be sweet. If you want to make the sweet kind use yellow-brown overripe plantains. I made that mistake when I first moved to Miami!"
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;sagirl17;5;these are great with chimichurri sauce! it's made from parsley, cilantro, garlic, lemon, and oil. look up the recipe!
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;accidentalfoodie;5;"I followed this recipe to the letter, and it's fantastic. I tried a green plantain this time-- very subtly sweet, and, as another reviewer mentioned, great with garlic salt. I'm allowing another plantain to ripen, so I'll try the recipe that way as well. To mash the pieces, I put them one-by-one in between pieces of baking parchment, then put that in a wide, flat bowl, stacked another bowl inside of it, and pushed down a bit. I also liked the fact that this recipe didn't require a whole lot of oil, though I used an 8-inch stainless steel pan so the pieces would sit a little deeper in the oil. The finished product goes great with black beans and rice; I will definitely be making this recipe again and again."
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;heather;5;These are awesome! I didn't use any water and my plantains were green. The trick is to hit them with salt the second they come out of the oil! I will definately be making these again!
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;lisamarshall;5;mmmm...I agree, don't need water and BUTTER is the way to go! I didn't add a spice at all and it was delish and just like I remember in Costa Rica.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;carolinec;3;I always order fried plantains at the local Cuban restaurant, but they are completely different to how these turned out. Not sure how they prepare them but theirs are sticky and sweet, and kinda stick in your teeth. These were really dry and tasteless. Oh well, thanks anyway!
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;kandiee;4;Follow the suggestions of LatinaCook, this lady knows what she's talking about. They are delicious. Just DO NOT put them in the water(unless you want your eyebrows and kitchen to burn up)! I served them with Oxtails w/ Gravy and Jamaican style Rice and Peas.

I made this side for my boyfriend, who is from Puerto Rico, for dinner; he was shocked that I did them correctly. His family serves this side or appetizer with different meals and I love eating them. But this was my first time trying my hand at cooking them. A little hint, we lightly season the tostones with Adobo after frying- Yummy!"
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;cookincalif;5;My husband is Puerto Rican and he introduced me to these when we went to San Juan. I loved them and had to make them. I use a press that we bought in Puerto Rico, but it is just as easy to use a bottom of a glass. I also salt the water that I soak them in.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;maryanneflynnpoeschl;5;I used to get tostones for lunch all the time when I worked in Manhattan. I missed them (and all good food) when I moved to CT.

0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;cookingjenny;5;I LOVE TOSTONES!!! To peel plantains: cut ends off, then cut down one side, then peel skin off while running under water. For a little sweetness and tang, use plantains that have some dark spots. A fully ripe plantain (black) is too soft for this recipe, but experiment for different flavors (green is savory, like potato). You can either skip the water step or dry thoroughly to avoid oil splatter. Dip them in crema fresca (Mexican table cream) for an added treat.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;chelsandjj;5;*Great recipe. Use the green plaintains as a savory side- as it is not sweet yet. Use cajun seasoning at the end for a kick. *Use the dark colored (black) plantains for a sweet dessert or balance to your meal. Sprinkle w/ just a little cinnamon, dark sugar, and nutmeg. *For both green or dark plantains, try the thousand island recipe, or buy store bought. *After frying, flatten between wax paper w/ a roller. I do not dip in cold water because I will set my house on fire.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;scottnyc;4;I'm a gringo but cook like a good Latino! For a richer taste (less oily) use equal parts butter and oil. Also sprinkle with a little sugar at the end. Makes 'em so good they'll all be gone in no time!
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;eileen;5;"It seems good, it's very simple, and it tasted great. I always add a garlic ""sauce"" to it. It's mashed up garlic with some salt, pepper, and oregano, or ""Adobo"", with some olive oil, If you use a garlic press, and let it sit in the olive oil for a while, it is the perfect sauce to go with these."
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;madball911;4;I love tostones! I generally don't bother with a dip, just some hot sauce. Don't do the water step, too dangerous. To ALEXISCRUZ, chinola is passion fruit.

0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;celeste;5;Delicious! I flattened them using the bottom of a coffee mug and refried them *without* dipping in water (too much oil splattered as a result...Ouch!). They were just as crispy as the water dipped plantains. Will make again and again!
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;latinacook;5;Also known as Platanos Fritos o Patacones. I make these all the time but i do not soak them in water. I just peel the plantain, slice it crosswise about 1 inch thick, fry just a little (they'll look yellow-er), press in the tostonera (or with the bottom of a can) , fry again until cripsy and golden and then sprinkle with garlic salt. Yum!! Ignore the rating of the person who burnt them, that is not the recipe's fault.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;msgypsylee;5;This is a great recipe for tostones. When I do the water dip before the second fry I use salt water instead of plain. It give the tostones a little extra flavor.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;kinnl;4;these were nice (served them as appetizers) especially with the dipping mayo/ketchup/garlic dipping sauce suggested by others. i tried the cold water step with one piece and my skillet went bananas (haha)! skip this step altogether. i couldn't tell the difference between the one i dipped in water and ones i didn't. will definitely make these again - great party food, i reckon.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;jenniferallen;5;I love PR cuisine! I have learned alot from a neighbor of mine and when we have these we make it with what she calls a secret sauce. The sauce is about 3 cloves crushed garlic,mayo and ketchup. Add to your taste along with a lil salt and pepper soooo good with the tostones!! Serve along side any dish or by their self awesome!!!
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;mel;5;These tostones were so good!! The step about dipping in water is good to do because it makes them more crispier. I only bought one plantain at the store. Now I need to go buy more!! Yummy!!
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;alexissantosvimos;5;As a Puerto Rican, I know and love platanos as well. They're an easy side dish and can take the place of other sides, like rice or potatos. I don't bother with the water, just fry, smash, and re-fry. Just make sure you use the green plantains for this recipe.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;mcfly3;3;Tostones are wonderful! Not heard of the 'dip in water' step. You would need to be very, very careful if you choose to do this, as it's the best way to begin a kitchen remodeling job if you are not careful. Hot oil and water are not friends at all :)
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;shortkaik;5;I love fried plantains. I didn't dip them in water like suggested, I didn't like the sounds of putting water in a frying pan. They still turned out excellent, and went well with a mix of ketchup/mayo that someone else had suggested. I will make these again for sure!
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;forgemaster;5;This is a variant of a West African dish in which plantains are cut into 1/4 inch thick slices and fried. I find that using peanut oil gives a sweeter taste.
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;lovetocook;5;Yummy, Yummy! I soaked my plantains for 15 minutes in salted water, patted them dry and then fried them. I flattened them between wax paper with the bottom of a glass. Dip them in the water again, patted them dry and then fried to a deep brown. Salted them immediately after taking from the oil and served them with a traditional half mayo, half ketchup dipping sauce. They are SO good and really easy!
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;rayandshy;5;just like i had them in costa rica--very, very easy and delicious!
0963f4ff-93f8-4ed4-a637-dae8e6c36d84;chabelyk;5;"I have made these all my life and I love them. A nice twist (and probably my favorite) is to make them with a ripe plantain (in which case they're called ""amarillos"". For making amarillos, the plantain must be at least yellow or almost throwing to ""too ripe""--close to blackening skin). Cut the ripe plantain into diagonal, long slices and fry them--keep an eye on them because they cook much, much faster--turn around and they'll be burnt!--and drain on paper towels. You can serve these with anything and are great solo. Because they're made with a ripe plantain, they're very sweet. My fiance doesn't really care for amarillos, but I wouldn't have my plantains any other way. I would give both of these a 3 kid rating because, depending on the kid, he or she will love the tostones/amarillos or just hate them. I grew up with them, so I simply adore them!"

I think these are under seasoned and I have never make a bean recipe that didn't have at least a little fat. I frequently make baked beans from plain canned beans and used the seasonings I have settled on. This would be a good starting point for people are just venturing into beans
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;adalton;5;Very good sauce. It was a little sweet so I added a couple teaspoons of cider vinegar to balance that. I think my ketchup was the problem.

021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;patrickaderr;4;A good base to modify from. I would use less water during the baking and add if needed. Also, I would increase the sauce recipe by 50%.

Even my son who said he doesn't like beans, but, came to the conclusion that it must be the other sauces that he doesn't like, lol. The only thing I did different was used Great Northern beans instead of Navy and added 1/4 teasp of liquid smoke. I also cooked them in the crock pot with the lid open a bit.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;jeremygrose;5;Added some dry mustard, some apple cider vinegar and skipped the molasses but doubled the brown sugar and put some dark rum in the sauce to stand in for the molasses. At the baking stage, I put 3-4 bacon strips on top. Excellent recipe. However, definitely add an avid element to the sauce to combat the sweetness and uncover the beans and increase the heat to 400 for the last hour in order to cook the beans down to the perfect sauce thickness. Otherwise, I make this again and again
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;lyndalukasiewicz;5;I will make again. Delicious!

021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;lynnebamford;5;I did add some mustard powder but other wise followed the recipe. It turned out great. I did do it in a slow cooker instead of the oven. One tip that my friend, who makes baked beans regularly, told me when the beans start to boil in the water to soften them to make sure they are the texture that you want before you put them in the pot with the rest of the mixture as they will not soften up much more during cooking. Also if, when the beans and water, start to boil turn the stove down so as not to spill over the pot but keep water at a nice boil with the lid removed. Watch the water but this will help with making the beans less gassy which is one complaint when it comes to eating beans.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;kimberly;5;I skipped the molasses and subbed diced tomatoes for the ketchup, great northern beans for navy--because it's what I had on hand. I also added chopped bell pepper and ham leftovers. These turned out great! This is a fabulous base recipe that you can do anything to personalize. Even my daughter who hates beans loved them.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;devinthomas;5;I loved this, but I made some changes. I didnt have any beans so I used tofu instead. Im allergic to molasses so I used artificial sweetener for coffee. The only meat I had was some old Spam so i deep fried it and added it it to pot. I'm scared of pressure cookers and crock pots so I microwaved the whole thing. My neighbor doesnt eat pork so I omitted any bacon or BBQ. My kids don't like spicy so I didnt season it at all. Hope ya'll get my point This is a good starting point recipe, make adjustments and use common sense when rating.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;melissamorita;5;Loved this recipe, I did add a little cider vinegar after reading the reviews plus a little dry mustard and it wasn’t too sweet.

021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;alanharaldson;5;HI. pretty good but have had better. left out the maple syrup. to get most of the gas out of the beans after they soaked over night and boiled for the hour I place the pot of hot beans in the sink and dumped in 3 to 4 heaping table spoons of baking soda into the beans. watch out as the reaction will cause the degassing of the beans will over flow the pot that is why i put it in the sink. stir the mixture to maximize gas removal. after the reaction is over dump the beans into a sieve to continue with the recipe. I also use a can of salt pork with most of the fat cut off and a large onion sliced thin. both these spread over the beans then spreading the sauce over everthing. this make it almost great. if you like a little more sauce taste in the beans make a little more sauce mix and before putting the pork and onions on top stir some of the mix into the beans and then put the pork , onions on top followed by balance of mixture. I guess i could say imdid not use much of the recipe and ended up using my grandmothers recipe which had some similarities. So in that case it is 5 stars

021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;gracelutvak;5;Delicious - a little bit sweeter than I would like, but still great.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;teacup;5;Rave reviews. I have been assigned to make this dish for future family get togethers. The only change I made was to use smokey maple syrup and add some pork.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;markkeefer;4;Very tasty! A little too sweet for me. The 2nd time I made this I left out the maple syrup and it was perfect!
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;betty;5;I made this for the first time and it was well worth the wait. I added salt pork o the basic recipe, otherwise I followed original recipe . I plan on making this soon again but doubling the recipe and using the crockpot instead. EXCELLENT!
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;barbara212;5;This is the second time I have made this. I made another recipe, which is terrible. I give this one 5 stars, i did not add any salt as my husband is on a salt free diet. It is so good! I did use half navy beans and half Great Northern beans. I may try the dry lima beans next time.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;sherif;5;These were labor intensive, but very good. All my guest loved them, and there was very little left. I wanted to have more control over the amount of sugar in my beans and I found I could do this with this recipe. I made as is with the exception of adding crisp chopped bacon at the very end this first time. Next time I will add a little bit more heat, and leave out the brown sugar as the molasses I used had enough sugar, and definitely double the recipe.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;jlc;5;Made it loved it! skipped the brown sugar based on other reviews
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;singleworkingmom;4;Good basic recipe but it needs something. I made this twice, the first time I made it exactly as the recipe stated. I was good but kind of bland. The second time I added bacon and liquid smoke as well as some mustard. It was better but still needs a little something. I am going to continue to add or change some ingredients until it is just right. One thing I can say, it makes your house smell Devine as it Cooks.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;teka218;4;I'm crazy for baked beans every since I was little and my grandmother made them every Sunday. I've been trying to find a recipe close to hers. I followed the recipe, also added bacon.There alright, but there just not like grama' s. These won't go to waste, we'll eat them , but I'll have to keep looking.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;pennycorkum;5;Easy and tasty
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;mamaws;5;I went pretty much right by the recipe and I baked them. they took a little longer to get thick then I expected. my husband even commented how wonderful they were..A lot of beans for 2 people! !
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;andreaerber;5;Fast version turned out great! Mixed the ingredients for a sauce on the stove over medium heat then added onion and 2 cans of beans (northern works fine too). Simmered for 10 mins and served. Husband said they were his favorite and it took me no more than 15mins. Perfect!
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;steve;4;Next batch I will add salt pork.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;maryellen;4;Good recipe. Too sweet for me so I left out the sugar and the syrup and used a little more molasses since I like the flavor. I used Lima beans for the base and added canned kidney and black beans when the limas were done. I also added prepared mustard and liquid smoke for flavor.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;maryknighten;5;I made this in the pressure cooker, no pre-soaking of the beans necessary! I pressured it for 30 minutes, did a quick release and then transferred to a 350 oven for @ 15 minutes to thicken it. I did add some ham pieces and a small chopped onion. I love it and I will make it on a regular basis instead of the canned pork and beans.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;stonefly;5;The beans came out beautiful, everyone loved them. I used 1 cup and a half of water to cover the beans while they cooked and it was a perfect ammount. I also added a half a cup of real maple syrup. I cooked them in a slow cooker for 10 hours instead of in the oven. This is the best baked bean recipe in my opinion. Will definitely make again and again!
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;francesca;4;This was very easy to make. I boiled the beans for an hour then put all ingredients into a crock pot on high for 4 hours. I added 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes and 1/2 lb of thick bacon. Be forewarned, it is *very* sweet!
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;julia;3;I soaked the beans overnight and put them in a crockpot for 9 hours on high (2 hours without the lid) and it still looked like soup. They tasted good but they didn't thicken up like I was expecting. I might try making this again with a lot less water than what the recipe calls for.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;valana;4;I have used this recipe several times now with a few adjustments. I soak my beans for 8 hours, boil them for an hour and then put them in the slow cooker. I use slightly less syrup and brown sugar. I add a teaspoon of vinegar (whatever I have on hand), and a half teaspoon of prepared mustard. I slow cook it overnight and it is ready for the next day. Thank you!
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;secretsmile;4;Giving it a 4 stars for technique. I modified the ingredients and amounts for my liking. I only let them bake 4 hours and they were really good. The beans held their shape and were gooey. Will make again and plan ahead to bake longer.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;teriscott;4;added vinegar, mustard, garlic, green pepper..
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;alice;5;Carnivores didn't even know they were eating vegan! This is a great recipe...sweet and spicy beans that get better every day! I've made them per recipe, with canned beans, in the crock pot, used a variety of beans, and it always turns out fabulous.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;magikat;5;My only mistake was not doubling the recipe! As a few others have suggested, I added 1 tsp apple cider vinegar and 1.5 tsp dry mustard. I also sauted a little bacon and the onion before adding them to the pot. I was going to skip the maple syrup. but the sauce smelled a bit too acidic. Then I remembered I had a bottle of dark maple syrup in the fridge. Worked out beautifully. Not too sweet and some nice depth of flavour.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;waynescottfeller;4;I made these as is, and they really deserve the five stars! They had an excellent balance of sweet and tangy, and my son and I loved them! A few people have mentioned how sweet these are. They are very very sweet. But as a side with a salty meat and non-sweet salad and dressing, thise was actually a good foil. On their own, they might be too sweet. You may wonder about the 4 instead of five stars. I loved the idea of beans that did not require bacon or salt pork. And they were good as is. However, I felt like the smoky flavour that these cured pork products bring was truly missing, even though the syrup does bring a modicum of smokiness to the recipe. I ended up adding one teaspoon of smoked paprika. This gave them a more apparent, albeit mild, smoky flavour without being overpowering, and without the need for adding fat through smoked meats. This really did add to the overall depth of the flavour. Having said that, even as is these are pretty good!
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;wyomingcrista;5;This is one of the best bean recipes I have ever made! We can't do sugar at our household so I use sugar free maple syrup and a brown sugar substatute. On my husband's request I also add cut up bacon. Now that we know we enjoy this I am up to 4x's the recipe. The bean keep well in the frig and the flavor just keeps soaking into them. I have also put the in quart bags and froze them with great results.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;nita;5;I am not a big fan of baked beans my fiance and daughter are so I wanted to try some from scratch for our Memorial Day dinner. I tried this recipe and couldn't stop eating the beans myself! (I was a bit confused by the scaling though because it says is makes 5 cups with only 1 cup of beans and when you try to change the number of servings, it starts with 10? We were having a few people over so I said I needed 40 servings and it was perfect even though I started with about 79 oz of beans). I used canned beans to cut down on some the cooking time we opted for great northern beans. I also cut out the chili powder and cooked bacon to add in. I sauteed the onion in the bacon fat and poured it all into the pan with the beans (I also seasoned the beans with seasoned salt) and added 2 tablespoons of dry mustard and a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar. (I also added a cup of water to make up for the cooking liquid in the recipe but will omit next time as it took the sauce too long to thicken). These were perfect, not too sweet as some of the reviews say (in fact, I added extra brown sugar to adjust to the sweetness level we were looking for). We will never use canned baked beans again!
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;loishewitt;5;I LOVE this recipe. I did as some of the others suggested: soaked overnight, cooked for one hour, then made in the crock pot. I doubled the recipe so that I could use the whole bag of beans (1#). The only thing I added was a tsp. of cider vinegar and a dash of mustard. The first bite was a little sweet but after only a second I was in heaven. These taste so much better than canned beans and I know exactly what went into them. For the cost of one can of name brand beans, I made a whole crock pot full. Thank you for the great recipe. I am going to always have these on hand!!
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;chrisaudi;5;"EXCELLENT RECIPE! This is the 4th time in the past 2months I have made these BAKED BEANS from ""scratch"". I have added diced uncooked bacon because I like the added flavor. My area food-bank will be getting ALL the ""canned bake beaned"" in my cupboard. Frankly, I always used to ""tweak"" canned beans whenever I made them. Not only is this recipe more cost effective than canned but they are oh so much better on the 'YUMMY"" FACTOR thanks WKNDYCHEF for taking the time to share this KEEPER of a recipe."
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;yepicancook;5;Whoever gave this less than 5 stars is drunk. I joined this website just so I could comment on this recipe. I soaked the dry beans overnight, threw them in the crockpot and decreased water to 3 cups. Added a 1/2 tsp of dry mustard and two slices of bacon in with all the other ingredients, and set the crockpot on low for eight hours. I came home from work and walked in the door and .. oh .. my .. god. The smell alone was enough to warrant the effort. Upon eating them, I died. Seriously. So good that I died. I'm using the allrecipes review forum as a medium from the other side. Excellent recipe.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;cookinstorm;5;My family loves it! The directions are easy to follow and the end result is fantastic.

021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;emmycurry;5;I LOVED this recipe and so did everybody else! I made this for thanksgiving and it was a huge hit! I'm not one for those spicy bean mixes, I'm definitely a sweet person, so this was perfect! I would useless water next time, I also cooked it in a slow cooker.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;girlking;5;After reading alot of the reviews I decided to try this recipe and I'm so happy I did. My family loved the beans. I followed the recipe to the letter for the most part only adding green bell pepper and minced onions to my recipe and cooking them in the crock pot in the final step (that way I could go to sleep). I'll use this recipe again and again for my family.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;lisa;4;These were really good - the sauce was thick and caramelized. I used all the cooking liquid from the beans adding it throughout the baking time. I followed the recipe exactly as written, but doubled it. That being said I won't be making this recipe again. The length of the cooking time combined with constantly having to monitor the beans when baking so they wouldn't dry out wasn't worth the taste payoff.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;areena;5;This recipe worked perfectly. The only things I did differently were partially cooking the chopped bacon beforehand so I could reduce the fat, and I just mixed everything together vs. layering. I was afraid the dish would be too sweet, but it wasn't. Good & easy, as long as you plan ahead. Thanks for the recipe!
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;erikagee;5;I made Coney dogs and these beans for a side dish tonight! My family loved them! I don't like beans of any kind so I did not try them (sorry) but everyone said they were great. I added bacon to them and doubled the sauce, to the sauce I added vinegar and mustard. Thank you for the recipe my family has really enjoyed it!
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;braids1997;5;Was making this for a large BBQ, so I had to triple the amounts. The sauce was great, but couldn't help adding 2 tbs. dry mustard, 1/4 cup vinegar & 1/2 tsp. liquid smoke for that bbq flavor, delishous! Thanks
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;bevsq1;5;This is the first time I made baked beans from scratch. I usually open a can of Grandma Brown's baked beans and add brown sugar then bake. These were so good and easy to make. I'll definitely make them again. I did add a cup of baked ham that I had in the freezer, but that was the only thing I did different.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;oakrunner;2;WAY too sweet!! I will omit the brown sugar or maple syrup next time. Maybe add a little bacon for depth of flavor.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;annamariefadorsen;5;Very tasty, and with the right soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce, it's gluten free and vegan! It doesn't make a lot, so I opt for a double batch.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;pamjlee;5;Very good, wouldn't change a thing
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;cerelle;4;This was a great base recipe for baked beans, but I like my food with a kick. I didn't use any molasses (didn't have any) and I added vinegar and mustard like suggested, but I also spiced it up with chipotles in adobo sauce, and everyone at my BBQ gave it rave reviews.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;lorichristopoulos;3;I may use this as a base and give one more try. It was rather watery for me. I followed directions exactly. I was looking for the old fashion, more starchy consistency. It has a very mild flavor, so would try adding pieces of bacon to it.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;buck98281;3;Made exactly as written, beans were a little dry & lacked flavor. Hoped they would have been sticky with lots of texture and stick to the spoon like Mom use to make, these were not what I was looking for.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;ming;4;DO NOT DO THIS: I followed directions from another reviewer and put all ingredients in crock pot overnight after letting beans sit in water for 8 hours. The beans were not nearly done 12 hours later! One must pour off the 4 cups of water and use only enough to cover beans as per original recipe! To remedy, i put beans in beanpot and cooked in oven at 350F until it began to thicken. Now it's ok.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;desiree;5;I soaked them over night. Boiled for an hour and then put it in the slow cooker for 6 hours. The BEST baked beans recipe!!!! I'll be making this again and again!
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;deejohnson;4;I doubled the recipe (1 # beans) and used a crock pot. Used pinto beans instead of the navy (had on hand), subbed A-1 and soy sauce for the Worcestershire (didn't have any), doubled the brown sugar, added 1 tsp dry mustard and 1# bacon. I only used 5 cups of water instead of the 8 it called for and it was still too soupy, even after 10 hrs on high and several hrs on low. I'm thinking the pinto beans swell and soak up much less than the navy beans. We still liked this recipe, just used a slotted spoon. I will try this recipe again with the great northern beans I have. Hopefully they will soak up the juice more. I'll also fry the bacon a little before adding to the pot.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;crash5456;5;These beans were really good, instead of salt I put in a nice piece of salt pork. It's a staple for a lot of recipes in my area :)
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;lynnshamrock;3;This was good, but it did not need to cook for 6 hours. It was really dry. I liked the flavors though. But, definitely not the best baked beans I've ever tasted.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;motherann;4;I had never made baked beans any way other than open a can of pork and beans and add some brown sugar and maple syrup. These are really good, though I would add more brown sugar next time just because I like it.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;dorothy;1;I followed this to a T. This was very sweet but bland. I don't think I will be saving this in my recipe box. Thanks, but no thanks.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;jana;4;Thank you for everyone's suggestions. I added 1 1/2 tsp mustard powder and 2 tsp apple cider vinegar, 3 slices of bacon crumbled, and sauteed the onion in the pan that the bacon was cooked in for a more complex flavor. I cooked this in my 8 in dutch oven and it overflowed a bit so I have to clean the bottom of my oven (which is due anyways). These beans came out amazing. I will be serving them later on in the week with hamburgers and red potato salad.

021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;lovetocook;5;Awesome beans! I made them exactly by the recipe, only I doubled everything and cooked them in the crock-pot. Absolutely delicious! My toddler couldn't get enough! A keeper for sure!
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;ajross;5;Added bell pepper, a couple shakes of hot sauce, and 1/4th cup brown sugar. Omitted Ketchup added 1 small can tomato paste and 2 tbs mustard. I feel sorry for my neighbors having to smell it all day. Cooked in crockpot low for 3 hours and high for 7 hours. Results were raved about.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;missy1979;5;I didnt use the onion and was out of worcestershire sauce. These were really good! My beans seemed a little dry, wonder why? I ll give 5 stars since I dont think the dryness was from the recipe but some thing this chef must have done wrong. Yummy flavor.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;nicholai;5;This was my third and final attempt at baked beans that weren't horrible - and they were exactly the opposite! This is a keeper for sure. I also added 1 finely diced green pepper, 1 tsp. vinegar, 1/2 tsp. dry mustard and a dash of poultry seasoning. I added a little less water after hearing it was too soupy, but mine actually turned out a little dry, so I would stick to the recipe. Although many people said they were too sweet, I found the opposite and added some brown sugar mid-way through cooking - perhaps because my molasses were unsweetened.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;dani;4;A bit on the sweet side but very delicious anyhow.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;jenny;4;We really liked these, nice flavor. Beats the can, thats for sure!

021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;h0t5auce;2;I give this recipe a two as kind of an average. Please note, I followed the recipe to the letter. People at the party left their beans on their plates. Here's how I came to the two average. The flavor is terrible. Too sweet, no kick and no dimension. The cheapest canned beans have more complex flavor. For technique, I would give this recipe five stars. This has got to be the way to cook beans for perfect texture. The problem here is in the ingredients. It should have been a red flag when there was no vinegar, no mustard, no roasted peppers, etc. The Worcestershire sauce and chili powder are no match for the syrup, molasses and brown sugar. I'll use this recipe as a guide to come up with beans that please a Midwestern crowd.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;joanneischay;5;I picked this recipe because I had all the ingredients. I received many compliments. Next time I may add bacon and maybe something to make them spicy. Very good baked bean recipe but I sort of like a kick to my food.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;adriennesydnor;5;I soaked the beans overnight and then put everything in the crockpot at the same time to let them cook. I also used ham to season the beans that I had left over from a Sunday dinner in the freezer. These beans were great. I would not change a thing. I cooked them in the crockpot on low overnight and then turned the crockpot up to high when I got up in the morning and let them cook for 3 more hours or so. They were soooooo good. My three year old who hardly eats anything loved them. She even asked for seconds and I had to fry her some chicken to go with the second bowl.Thanks for the great recipe.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;sthorpe;5;This recipe is wonderful. I cut the Maple syrup in half, because we often think recipes are to sweet. I also put it all in the crockpot all day and took the lid off for the last hour or so to thicken them up a bit. I will be making this recipe many times. Thank you

021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;suzy;5;Fantastic when used as a base recipe. I added white vinegar (1-2 tsp), 1/2 tsp dry mustard, a dash of poultry seasoning and used red kidney beans as that was what we had on hand. It needs a tang to counter the sweet. I also cooked the onion and garlic first for a more complex flavor.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;loriindetroit;5;The first time I made this, I used pancake syrup and it was way too sweet. I just made this recipe again. Except this time I used pure maple syrup. It was fantastic.

I doubled the whole recipe this time. As written, the recipe says it will serve 10, but that seems very unlikely to me."
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;carollou3;5;I added mustard, minced green pepper, ground beef, and omitted the maple syrup to the recipe. Very tasty, we served with corn bread for a complete meal. We will definitely be making again.
021225d2-16e5-4107-a67c-71b566d8f557;carolynbrown;4;Everybody in my family liked this, though we all found it too sweet. The long cooking definitely adds a richness and depth of flavor. I added mustard in with the ketchup mixture, and a half pound of partially cooked bacon and some leftover grilled bratwurst. I also found the beans quite soupy, though that may be because I cooked them in a cast iron Dutch oven and couldn't drain them well after the initial boil. (The soupiness was corrected with cooking after the first three hours at 225 and then for 1/2 hour at 400 before serving, as I was baking muffins.) Next time I think I will omit the maple syrup and use only the brown sugar, and again add mustard and bacon.

72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;chefgerard;5;Instead frying in the skillet, I baked it. Great flavor.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;bettydraganski;5;I will make this again. I added some garlic powder as others suggested and paprika for color. I did not add the fresh juice till after I turned over the fish. I added lemon zest to the juice for extra flavor. I believe that it will be tasty with any other white fish fillets.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;lutzflcat;3;I used cod and could not even taste the freshly-squeezed orange and lemon juices, only lemon pepper seasoning. Adding the juices to the fish at the beginning and then flipping the fillets left you with zero fresh juice flavor. This cooks so quickly that there’s no time for the juice to infuse the fish and when you flip to the other side to finish cooking, the juice just quickly evaporates…hope that makes sense to you. If I were to make this again (unlikely), I’d wait until the fish is nearly cooked on the other side and then drizzle with the juices. It also could use a garnish of some sort like chopped parsley or cilantro, has no eye appeal.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;leticiaalvarado;5;Good recipe. I tweeked it to my liking and my calorie intake. I sprayed the fish and shrimp (I used 8 oz of raw shrimp also) with butter spray and seasoned with old bays, Ground himalyan pink salt, fresh grpund pepper, lemon pepper and I also used a little garlic powder on the shrimp. I used 1.5 tsp of olive oil, 3 cloves garlic (2 minced, 1 sliced) 5-6 chopped leaves of fresh basil. I warmed it all up in the oil before adding the fish, shrimp and juice. Fish cooked for 5 minutes added shrimp at halfway mark.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;lindar;5;Very simple and yummy. Added a little garlic salt too.

72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;pearlglisson;4;I used this recipe on tilapia. It was a good flavor. However, I don't recommend adding the lemon/orange juice prior to cooking the fish. Brown the fish first, then add the juices. This will keep you from over cooking the fish.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;barbarab;1;It's probably not fair to give this one star, because I didn't use orange roughy, but I wouldn't used a fished-out species. I used Pacific cod, and it came out very bland. Perhaps not enough lemon, but I covered it well with lemon pepper. Still bland. Oh, well.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;hp23;5;DELISH!!! doesn't even need salt. I used lime juice instead of orange juice. Still yummy!

72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;cartoonrckr;5;My first time making any recipe with this fish and it was absolutely fantastic. Insanely easy to make and truly delicious. My kids (2 & 5) gobbled it up and asked for more. I need to buy more next time so I can go back for seconds like they did. I did make this in a cast iron skillet which I strongly recommend. It created a lovely sear on it. I put it on high to get all the juice to evaporate, then lowered the heat to medium or so to get the sear and allow it to cook through. It probably took 10-15 minutes, not 5.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;jportil;4;Very tasty and healthy
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;ntb;5;Used regular pepper as I was out of lemon pepper
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;jeff;5;Very nice glaze for a firm white fish. I used corvina (akin to Atlantic drum) and followed a couple of mentioned recommendations (old bay on the fish, fresh basil and garlic in the oil). Paired it with roasted root veggies and sauted zucchini shreds. Delicious.

72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;annacatespersonalchef;4;Ok. I think I'm just not a huge orange roughy fan. Might try on grouper another day.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;dotleasurelangley;5;The plan was to use it on fish but I did not I used it on chicken in the frying pan and it turned out pretty good. I let the chicken get brown very tasty
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;kswetz;5;Absolutely loved it! So easy! I had about 24 oz of Orange Roughy fish. Instead of juicing an orange and lemon, I simply used 5 Tbl of Orange Juice and 3 Tbl of Lemon Juice. If you had exactly a pound of fish, you could probably do 3 Tbl OJ and 2 Tbl of Lemon juice. I didn't have lemon pepper so I just lightly dusted with regular black pepper. Definitely going into the dinner rotation!

72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;hrussellm;5;Will be making this again soon. My wife is not a big fish eater so I am trying to get her to try a lot of different fish with sauces and she loved this recipe. She says she will be requesting that again soon. I am sure it has nothing to do with the fact I was the cook and not her.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;raisputin;5;This was super easy to prepare and as a guy that doesn't really enjoy cooking, even I can do it in no time flat, and it turned out absolutely brilliant. We will definitely be making this again!!!

72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;calico8883;5;Wow, so good! I put some garlic cloves in with everything else. I also sliced some butter and put it on top of the fish. Then covered the pan until the fish flaked. I never thought of adding some Old Bay Seasoning, like someone else suggested. I will have to try that next time! I remember my grandmother making orange roughy for me. The taste always brings back great memories.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;kim;5;Not a fish lover, but I may be now! This was fabulous..no fishy taste & I added a little lime juice too! Fast, easy & yummy!!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;equus1jw;5;Husband went on and on about this! It is fool proof! I'm a decent cook but not great and fish is not my strong point. My husband (who's trying to watch his cholesterol) kept asking how much butter I put in this to make it so good and buttery. He was shocked when I told him none, just a tiny drizzle of olive oil in the pan. Just put oil then fish in pan, poured juice of one lemon and one orange over top, shook on some lemon pepper and let it simmer until it was flakey. I did grate a little of the orange and lemon peel into the juice. Couldnt be easier!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;sunshinejo1717;5;We really liked this recipe, I've made it a few times. I made no changes except for adding a few sprinkles of lemon pepper. Fantastic!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;jackieb;4;I really liked it, I did not think it would be so flavorful! I used lime instead of lemons. I also used sea salt, pepper, and Mrs. Dashes to marinate for about 10 minutes. Then I cooked the fish a little and then added the orange/lime blend. Went great with peas/carrots mix (using the marinade from the fish) and some white rice (not my favorite, but I needed something quick). I would like to try it again when I can marinate it a little longer with the juices!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;stax4;5;I cant believe how good this was. There was this awesome juice left on the pan after baking it and we added that to my already seasoned rice. Nothing left afterwards. So good. Oh and I baked it instead and added two tablespoons of butter to the sauce before baking because everything is better with butter.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;finecuisine;5;This was extremely easy to make and really good. I did add a couple of sprinkles of rosemary to it ans some asparagus in the pan with it, and it was delicious.

72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;aphrodite;1;I used cod since orange roughy is endangered. I looked up what else to use instead, and cod was one of the options. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but the favors just didn't taste that good. Maybe it was the fish itself, Idk. I won't make again.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;lizwaz;5;Fantastic with any type of flaky white fish, i.e. flounder, tilapia, even grouper. I like to heat the oil in a large saute pan, cook the fish about 4 minutes over med-high heat until just browning, then flip, pour the juice over it, cover and remove for heat. In about 5 minutes, it's perfect every time. The 'sauce' is fantastic over rice, quinoa or couscous straight up, reduced or thickened with a little corn starch. Works great with lemon or lime juice, whatever's on hand. Love this recipe and it's so simple even the kids can make it. Thank you!!!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;rpm911;5;Rate the recipe, not the fish.... Orange roughy probably is not the best choice, but not 'endangered'... Except in Australia.... I suggest swai...

I didn't have any fresh lemons, so used bottled and seasoned with a little S&P. Would make again, but maybe cut down on the lemon juice & DEFINITELY use fresh.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;eila;5;This is a very tasty, healthy and unusual sauce for fish. It was easy and quick to make. My husband and I enjoyed this recipe very much. I used orange juice with pulp, lemon and 1 lime. I will definitely make this again.

After browning both sides, I put on the lemon/orange sauce and cooked on medium to reduce the liquid. It was so excellent and I served it with quinoa/mushroom dish from this site.

72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;edwardyamamoto;4;The recipe was great. I use a lot of the recipes here and modify to accommodate my weight watchers diet.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;bubbielinda;5;Delicious! Followed the recipe exactly. Served the leftover fish the next night as fish tacos. Was also delicious! Thank you for this quick, easy and tasty recipe!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;kittylover25;4;I loved the orange/lemon sauce. However, after trying Orange Roughy for the first time, I have realized I don't care for it. So next time I think I will try this with a different white fish. Super easy though!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;shelbiw;5;This recipe is so easy and delicious..Thank you
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;huntersmama;5;ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!! My husband made homemade lemon pepper and we followed the directions exactly (except we used at least a tablespoon of the lemon pepper). I can't say enough good things about this! Cooked it for about 7 min...until the sauce started to thicken a bit. My 21month old son even loved it, and he won't usually eat ANYTHING new! We served this with organic quinoa with no additional seasoning added. TRY THIS, YOU'LL LOVE IT!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;eriley;4;fresh fish is the way to go but even with frozen, it was tasty and quick. My boys loved it.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;sherishep;4;Love it! The fish is so moist and the taste is light so it does not cover the taste of the fish.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;mindysauve;4;This is super easy and the sauce is very tasty. I used frozen roughy fillets and I think I need to try it again with fresh...no fault of the recipe, simply the fish. I would use this sauce on other mile fillets in a heartbeat. Thanks for the recipe.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;brie07;3;I didn't like the lemon pepper addition but I might have put too much. I actually flipped my filets over after three minutes and sprinkled the lemon pepper on both sides. Don't recommend. I served over Jasmine rice which was great. I added a little ground cayenne pepper to both. Super easy but will probably not make again. It wasn't bad I just found the citrus flavor overwhelming.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;hollyt;5;This recipe was phenomenal! We're not big fish easters in our house, but all 4 of us LOVED this. I will be making this again & again. Thanks so much!!!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;deb;5;Loved this - very quick, light and full of flavor. This recipe is a keeper!!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;mandiopdyckewinland;5;Great, healthy, easy. I used 2 Tablespoons orange juice and 1 Tablespoon lemon juice instead of the fresh orange and lemon. Not a lot of sauce, but enough for good flavor. Dinner was ready in literally 10 minutes!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;stephanie;5;My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I had the orange roughy and didn't know what to do with it. So I checked out this site for something quick, easy and ingredients that I had on hand. I also used orange juice and lemon juice. My kids did not like the fish. They usually eat it (not so much because they love it) but because they have to have a little bit. But tonight they wouldn't eat it. I don't know why. I think the citrus was a bit much for them. I will definitely make this for my husband and myself again!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;cindym;5;My husband and son said this tastes as good as a dish from a high end restaurant! Using homestyle type orange juice instead of juicing an orange makes this a very quick and easy recipe.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;annholds;1;Not good at all. The combinations of flavors were not complementary.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;rachelmanevalrode;5;Very good compliment to orange roughy indeed. Will definitely make again!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;wasson;5;I followed the recipe exactly. It was honestly the best fish dinner I've ever had. - and I actually made it myself! This was the first recipe I've tried from this website. It was so good and so easy to make. If I can have this recipe turn out so wonderfully well, anyone can! :) Thanks for sharing this recipe. ~I'll be making this often!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;melissa;1;This was kind of gross! I was surprised.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;christyn95;5;This recipe is delicious! I had never heard of Orange Roughy before until I went to the grocery store looking for salmon and they were out. The guy at the fish counter told me about this fish and gave me a garlic recipe (verbally), which I forgot once I got home. I looked up Orange Roughy on here and found this recipe! My husband LOVES this recipe and it is my go-to recipe because it is so quick an easy, and there is virtually no clean-up. I use orange juice (rather than an orange)and lemon juice from a container (rather than a lemon), and lemon pepper, and that is it! I have made this recipe for friends and family and it has been a hit. Thank you for sharing your recipe, it has been added to mine, and is now one of my staple recipes!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;erinnruss;5;Easy, Fast, and Yummy!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;beck1123;5;This was very easy, very light and very tasty. Even my second grader liked it! I will definitely make again and try with other fish too.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;evar;5;This was moist & tender. I couldn't believe how good this turned out. I never thought it would be this delicious. My husband said it was over the top. This is definitely a keeper.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;sandy;3;We found this recipe rather ordinary. Nothing special at all. My 5 year old wouldn't eat it at all, however. I won't be making it again.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;ctwombly;5;I really don't like fish but I loved this recipe. I used 1/2 a lemon and a navel orange! I'm definately making this again.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;tahoegirl;5;fresh and light tasting -- this is the best way to prepare orange roughy. i added a splash of lime juice as well.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;bogzu;5;Wow! Easy and really delicious and nutritious.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;tiffanymuozsantos;3;My husband and I love Orange Roughy, but this recipe was a bit sour. Normally I put lime in just about every fish recipe, but I think the OJ and lime was a little too much. However, we ate the finished meal and won't be turned away!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;christinaturner;2;Bland.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;joditatedenney;5;Very good, quick and easy. I think any fish can be subsistuted for the roughy.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;suzthecook;5;it was quick and very delicious
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;luvnsamranor;4;I just got finished eating this tonight. Some how it came out a little salty. I didn't add any salt at all either. Not sure how or what caused it but I did have some help in the kitchen and that always throws me off a bit...will give an update when I try this again..but there were some parts that weren't as salty and they were magnificent.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;punkgirl;5;A hit with the whole family. Served with Almond Currant Rice from this site and they paired well.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;jem;3;Too citrus-y for my family's tastes.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;debrascalice;4;I've made this a couple times now...and it works with fresh or bottled juices! Easy, and light....for a nice, tasty, healthy meal.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;bkluyt;5;Fantastic!! Light, sweet and just plain easy. I marinated it for an hour and poured it all into a pan for about 6-8 minutes. Yummy!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;allrecipescommunity;3;It was definitely easy and quick to make. But my husband and I thought it was a bit on the plain side.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;debbie;5;I just made this 2day.My hubby did not like it but I loved it.Very quick & easy 2 make.Taste great.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;shanar;5;the fish was so fresh and zesty and so very easy to prepare!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;samdoug;4;This is a really good recipe. I thought the sauce we delicious, and I will try it on other things also. I used bottled oj and lemon juice and a little citrus seasoning ( I did not have the lemon pepper seasoning) I used more than it called for and it turned out great with enough sauce leftover to pour on the fish. A very yummy, light dish.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;sarabella;5;So good! I used bottled orange and lemon juices and just as good. I also tried it a second time with tilapia, which was just as tasty!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;venusmcdaniel;4;This was a great recipe. I couldn't find orange roughy, so I substituted with tilapia. It turned out great. The first time I made the recipe, I used the lemon pepper seasoning and it was kind of bland, so this time I used Montreal chicken seasoning. It was absolutely wonderful. My guests loved the recipe. The next evening I made fish tacos with the left overs and added creole seasoning. Yummy!!!!!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;mikepreston;5;This was awesome!! I added fresh Lime Juice and was very pleased, tried it with Salmon also add was very good. My wife and kids loved it, oh yeah, and so did I. It left a nice sauce that I poured over the fish once it was on the plate. This will be a repeat recipe in our home.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;aestheri;1;"Depending on the oranges, this sauce can be a little sweet; it also coagulates rapidly, leaving an unattractive plating.It worked fine on tilapia and was okay on local trout, but watch the oranges."
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;liz;5;This recipe was absolutely phenomenal! It was easily made, and was quite quick. I followed the recipe here exactly, continually spooning the lemon-orange juice-lemon pepper mixture in the skillet back over the fish as it cooked, and had just enough juice left over. Thanks for the fabulous recipe!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;shorty2007;4;I followed the recipe as is except used black pepper and salt instead of lemon pepper. This is really easy to make and tastes great. I would make it again.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;sophie;4;Made this recipe exactly as is. It did have a lot of citrus flavor, but that's not necessarily a bad thing (look at the name of the recipe, lol). I'm not sure what it was, perhaps I just don't like Orange Roughy or maybe it was the actual fish that we bought. That's why I'm giving it a 4 and not 3 stars.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;rickybrown;5;My co-worker and I used this recipe on the ship we work at and the crew loved it. Insted of pouring the juice onto the fish we let it marinade in it for about an hour. Im sure more time would have made it even better.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;tofu19;4;These were ok. Very simple to make for sure.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;jenniferearnest;1;neither my husband nor I was able to finish it. The entire concoction was extremely bitter and did nothing to enhance the flavor of the fish.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;252becky;5;I didn't think I was good at cooking fish, but this recipe made me change my mind. It was so easy. You've got to try it!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;lucinda;1;I did not like this at all. Maybe I just don't like Orange Roughy.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;mrsrobinson97;4;"Good, quick & easy; it was a little on the sour side - we ate this with jasmine rice and the rice mellowed out the sour tang."
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;foodluvin;5;Great base recipe. I tweaked it a bit. First I added Old Bay, salt and ground black pepper to all purpose flour and coated fish in it. Used 3 clementines (only oranges I had), half lemon and quarter of a lime. Added fresh lemon basil (had no lemon pepper) with some cilantro to the juice before pouring it over the fish in the skillet. Added fresh garlic to the oil and a little lemon basil too prior to putting fish in it. Added ground peppercorns to fish in the pan. Great sauce, can also use on tilapia. Will double the juice contents if using clementines again as I would've liked more of the sauce - used 2 fillets (approx 1lb).
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;jrhone;3;This was just okay. After reading reviews, wanted to make sure I didn't over-do the juices and probably could have used more. A little bland. We'll give it one more try.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;lesley;5;Tasted great, and super easy to make. My 9 year old son loved loved loved it!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;lane;4;This was easy and very good!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;erin;5;"I made this recipe in an ""emergency"" situation where I found myself with some roughy on hand and no plan for how to fix it. Seems most other fish recipes on this site called for heavy cream, which I didn't have. I used one whole (but very small) orange, one whole lemon and half a lime. This made quite a bit of juice for three very good sized filets. The juice took a bit to reduce down but by the time it reduced, the fish was done so no problem there. Seasoned the fish with Old Bay, some dried dill weed and black pepper (as I didn't have the lemon pepper on hand either). I was very pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I was worried it would be dull, but it really had a good amount of flavor without overpowering the fish. FYI, I used Trader Joe's white roughy (found in the freezer section)which is simply divine and a must try if you haven't had it yet. This dish was perfect for a summer night dinner. My husband said he could easily use this sauce for shore lunches on his next fishing trip with the guys."
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;nandabear;4;It turned out moist and delicate but I had to add a little more seasoning because I new it would be bland otherwise. I added freshly grated sea salt, some fresh lemon basil and fresh dill, also a little more freshly ground pepper. I really enjoyed it.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;savsmom;5;awesome recipe!! made it exactly as recipe calls for.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;2kater;5;Excellent--Easy--Enjoyed by Everyone!!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;erikamd;5;A very quick, easy, and tasty way to prepare your fish! It's great with a variety of white fish, whichever you have on hand. I brought a ton of ripe lemons and oranges home from a Florida trip and this was a good way to use some instead of just making juice!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;bethgarrisonkemp;5;My family loved this--even the non-fish lovers. I sauteed some shallots before adding the fish and juices. We'll definitely make this one again!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;sherrygraziosemichael;5;Very good, I added a little garlic, very moist and delicious.will definitely make again
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;georgesgirl99;4;This recipe was very simple and tasty. Like others suggested I floured the filets first. I also sauted some garlic in the oil first before putting in the fish. I will make it again.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;happywife;5;This was so simple and quick and had terrific flavor. I love fish, but orange roughy in particular has always been a favorite. The recipe doesn't specify how much lemon or orange to use. I used a medium lemon and large orange and thought it was perfect. You won't be dissapointed with this recipe.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;varucadarling;4;Very good, but I think it needs a little more seasoning. It was a little blah. I ended up adding some basil, garlic, and a little seasoned salt. Other than that it was a good start to an excellent meal.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;rainstripe;4;This recipe was pretty good but not really memorable in my book. I used wild whitefish fillets instead of orange roughy and followed the recipe as written, although I found I had so much juice that it was more like pour the juice over rather than drizzle. I turned my fillets partway through and they cooked very nicely in the citrus. I think next time I will remove the fish and then reduce the pan juices, hoping for more of a syrup. I'll also add cilantro like someone else mentioned. Nice and healthy, that's for sure!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;christine;5;This was delicious!! I did tweak it a little bit-I dredged the fillets in seasoned flour, sauteed them in the olive oil until golden, then added the citrus juices and let it cook a bit. I also cut out the dark fish fles before cooking as I find that is what gives it a strong or fishy taste.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;appletini;5;So easy to prepare! Sauce was delicious, although I might add a little butter to it next time around. Of course that just adds fat and defeats my goal of fixing low-fat healthy recipes!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;leahnwells;4;Very good and so easy. My only suggestions to the recipe are to add salt to taste and provide measurements of the orange and lemon juice, as these vary greatly by the size and quality of the fruit. I used small fruits for my version, and it turned out just right for us. I made three different types of fish (perch, orange roughy, and tilapia) to see which I preferred. I thought the orange roughy was best by a mile, but the others would be fine in a pinch. My husband preferred the perch.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;ericmars;5;Absolutely delicious simple sauce. I made the sauce with a little marjoram, sage, and a touch of butter in a pot and reduced it a bit. I cooked the fish on the grill for a few minutes per side, basting it with the sauce. Rave reviewsfrom all.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;zopooh;3;I will give this a three because the sauce was good especially after it reduced and got thick. The fish on the other hand......YUCK it was my first time having orange roughy I wish someone would have said how fishy it tastes. I would however use the sauce on tilapia or maybe tuna steaks.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;dixie1261;4;Pretty good flavor. I was suprised at the consistency when it was all done. Would use this recipe again as a change of pace when it comes to fish.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;quasinaught;5;This was the easiest to make. It was one of the best fish recipies I have made. My husband who is picky when it comes to fish even liked it. I had to use talapia because I couldn't find oarnge roughy. I can't wait to try it with oarnge roughy.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;mar;5;I was really surprised by how flavorful this is even after reading reviews. Both my picky husband and son loved it.

72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;vividoc99;5;I used tilapia and it was great. We don't like fish too much but the combo of the orange and lemon juice was great AND we added more lemon-pepper. It's the first fish I was able to get my toddler to eat too (and we thought she just didn't like fish)! Thanks so much.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;joeyr;5;Awesome. Melted in your mouth. Such simple ingredients made an amazing sauce.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;my2rotties;5;To die for! This sauce was so flavorful and tasted rich. It is low fat, and almost sinful at the same time.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;flo;5;Quick and easy to prepare. I added cilantro to the fish as it finished frying in the pan and it turned out great! Definitely don't skimp on the lemon and orange juices. It's a great way to get in your helping of fish.

We try to eat fish a few times a week and this will definitely be a keeper. The fish went from pan to plate in less than ten minutes. Phenomenal! The taste was fresh and citrusy without being overpowering at all. Can't wait to try it on the grill when the weather warms up. Bet it would be good on chicken, too, with some fresh cilantro. Mmmmmmmm! Thanks!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;rashelfitchett;5;Wow! A perfect combination of sweet-citris and fish. I hate fish, but eat it for health reasons, and now I will look forward to eating it. I used a large naval orange (juiced) and 1/4 C of commercial lemon juice. It took much longer for my fillet to cook...about fifteen minutes, which was nice, because the juices thickened up real nice and stuck to the fish better. I served it with brown rice, green beans, and vinegared-tomato slices. Yum, Yum!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;tpm;4;This was very juicy and easy!!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;jkeary;5;This recipe was very easy to prepare. My boyfriend, who does not normally eat fish, loved this dish.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;thuesen;3;I thought this was just ok....but I don't know if it was the fish or the lemon/orange sauce I wasn't keen on...Very easy though!!!

72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;shellyharris;4;Delicious!
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;22566;5;Speedy, excellent, healthy entree. Use plenty of fresh-squeezed orange and lemon juice (also try lime...very good). The juice will reduce in the frying pan to form a wonderful subtle-flavored sauce. Don't use store-bought orange juice...when reduced it tastes much too strong, almost like marmalade, and will take away from the natural flavor of the fish.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;mollylowemendoza;5;This was wonderful and easy. It gave the fish a buttery texture. I'm making it again tonight for the second time in 10 days!!

72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;carriemagill;5;I used 2 tbsp orange juice and 1 tbsp lemon juice (not fresh squeezed), and the flavor was still fantastic. Very light and delicious! We enjoy having this with French Green Beans from this site.

72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;olzawski;4;Easy recipe. Great way to prepare fish. I didn't have an orange but I did have some dried orange peel which worked great in place of the juice. I look forward to trying this with fresh caught crappie, bass, and catfish we are able to catch from the nearby lakes.
72025d76-e3cc-488f-b6d2-399d68049120;kim;5;Excellent Recipe. I will make this again.
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;tlwise7023;5;It was good! I did add less salt because I am on a low-sodium diet.
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;donnacarrmurico;5;So happy I found this, never tried my hand at turkey soup and it turned out awesome.
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;carol;5;Great recipe! I made it with the suggestions of the review below that doubled the spices (Doug), but it was a little too spicy for our tastes. Next time, I will not double the poultry seasoning or the pepper. Also, I made the broth the day before and chilled overnight so I could skim off the fat. I let it simmer several hours the day I made the broth and again the final day to reduce the broth (I used 4 quarts of water) for a stronger turkey flavor. It was very tasty and had great turkey flavor!
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;ohiowolverine;5;Very good, I added a little leftover turkey gravy amd used broth for more flavor. I'm trying to figure out why the onion powder is needed after so much onion is in the recipe to begin with? I skipped it.
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;justins;5;As others have said, a great starter recipe. I added some leftover canned green beans, as well as use chicken broth instead of water.
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;eclare;4;I used all of Doug’s suggestions and also added a bag of frozen peas at the end. It’s very flavorful but next time I’d go easy on the pepper! Still a wonderful soup! Thanks for the suggestions!
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;dianesalvatoreboyer;5;This soup was very good. I will definitely make it again.
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;georgiwellington;4;I added more garlic, salt and pepper and a lot more turkey. It was great!
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;lindarabenerjustice;4;Changes made were using lots of leftovers from the holidays. I had made broth in November, saved turkey and used the roasted veggies left over from a family gathering on New Year's Day.
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;maureen;5;This was a terrific recipe. I didn't have turkey bones/carcass so, for more flavor, I used Better Than Boullion, Chicken flavor. MAde homemade biscuits and it was a wonderful meal.
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;cecepeterson;5;"I made this exactly as written, and we loved it. I've made turkey rice soup before but it was always very bland. This tasted like Thanksgiving in a bowl! Thank you for a keeper recipe; I'll be making this every year, with the remains of our turkey."
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;gabriellegallaghermckinney;4;I added a lot more spices, used fresh garlic, celery, carrots and onions in the soup (no frozen veggies) plus twice as much rice. Husband loved it. Will definitely make this again.
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;brookspfaff;5;Delicious!! And easy to prepare!! None of my wife's hard work for Thanksgiving dinner went to waste
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;jadewisdom;4;I added celery seed throughout and I also added a some smoked paprika to my stock when cooking the turkey
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;brendamurphy;5;Delicious
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;130smith;3;It needed more vegetables and less water. But otherwise it was okay.
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;billtee;4;No just as it is oh I added chicken gizzards yum
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;kathiebud;5;No real changes, except I eliminated the peas...not my favorite vegetable.

8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;saraweiss;4;Simple and good.
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;margop;5;Instead of rice, I used Orzo, which was my grandmother's recipe. She came to the USA from Greece when she was only 16 years old. Her special soup would make me well fast whenever I had a cold or flu.
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;doug;4;"After reading the other reviews and knowing that turkey rice soup can be a bit bland if you aren’t careful, I took most of the advice submitted by others and will summarize what I did differently to reach the rating I gave the soup. I refrigerated the stock when it was done then skimmed off the fat the next day. After letting the stock reach room temperature, I added chicken bullion (1 cube or 1 tsp), I doubled all the seasoning (including the garlic) listed in the recipe plus added 1 tsp of parsley to ensure a flavor boost. Before I put in the meat and rice, I added 4 tsp of salt (this took the soup to a good base that people could add a bit more if they wanted) and 2 tsp of pepper. I agree with one of the other reviews that more meat is needed so I added 2 more cups of turkey; adding one more cup of rice gave it the consistency I was looking for. Hope this helps anyone out there who wants to try this easy recipe and is looking for more flavor. Enjoy!"
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;apmajones;5;Delicious and so easy to prepare. I froze some turkey to make it again later. Thank you!!!
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;faithrada;5;This was a really substantial soup. I left out the celery and swapped out the poultry seasoning for some sage. Plus, I added cooked rice at the end ...for each bowl. I will definately make this version again.
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;catdancing24;4;I used powdered Rosemary, because that is what I had. I also added some thyme and parsley to the final cooking. I wasn't sure how much salt to add, so, next time I will put in a couple teaspoons. This is a great basic recipe, and would be good with brown rice, wild rice, or some kind of noodle as well as the plain white rice.
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;c208b;5;I made this to recipe I only added 1 tsp of poultry spice to stock and I did refrigerate the stock overnight to skim the fat off, which I think you should always do!. It made 8 us quarts of stock and I seasoned with 6 to 6.5tsp. of salt and the rest of spices from recipe. I found it had a lot of flavour and the whole family loved it. I would definitely recommend to try it out.
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;momofone;4;I had already made broth from the two turkey frames I had so I skipped that step. I added a lot more spices and herbs, cooked wild rice and stirred in creamed spinach (leftover about 2 cups) just to heat through, gave a creamy finish and some additional veg. Yummy!
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;pamstephens;4;I love the idea of using the carcass as the base, but I felt the taste was missing some depth or something. Fairly bland, but I couldn't put my finger on what was missing. Will probably make this again using this as a frame work and tinker with it as I go.
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;juanitamolina;4;Very good recipe! Will use again.
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;dba;4;Very good soup. It was delicious and so quick and easy to make. I dislike soups that take hours and hours to make and this made up reasonably quickly and very tasty.
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;swannorton;4;I loved having a way to get use from a turkey carcass leftover from Thanksgiving. The soup is basic as others mentioned, but I found adding a bit of ground ginger or cayenne to individual bowls added nice spice. The recipe froze and reheated well, so i was able to enjoy the soup during the cold winter months.
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;thecowboysgirl;4;It was yummy and easy!
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;maryporter;4;This is a good classic Turkey carcass soup recipe. The only change I made was to add chicken broth instead of water. Gives it an extra punch of flavour. I also added more Turkey meat- about 2 cups more.
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;cole84;5;Amazing soup only thing I did was leave out the onion but otherwise amazing
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;nicole;3;I give it 3 stars as it's written. A good starter recipe. I added way more seasonings than what's called for because it was too bland. I added a lot more of the black pepper, more salt, more garlic and onion powder, a chicken bouillon cube and a couple dashes Worcestershire sauce. Made it twice once with rice and another time with elbow macaroni.
8e322949-3103-4d0b-a555-789c248e5b40;cindy;5;Just made this soup today and it was fantastic........if I do say so myself! The only thing I changed was I used egg noodles instead of rice.
50561f85-c45a-4524-bfbb-2c0c120ab233;cheyannebrady84;1;Terrible! Would not recommend. They look nothing like the picture.
50561f85-c45a-4524-bfbb-2c0c120ab233;elizabethlenz;1;Not at ALL like the picture. A food dehydrator may have worked. Mine were black, stuck and not even the texture of gummy worms. Lemon did not make bananas not turn brown.
50561f85-c45a-4524-bfbb-2c0c120ab233;avinashkumar;5;Banana chips can be heated or seared. Anyway heating may take somewhat more time than browning. Conjointly southern style banana chips taste magnificent. https://www.letsdiskuss.com/how-can-we-make-banana-chips-at-home

f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;sabrina;5;Addictively good! I backed off the sweetness some, and prefer to use honey with this instead of sugar and find that it adds another dimension of flavor on an already great recipe. I will note though, it’s one of those dishes that really should be eaten fresh. After the first day, the flavors start mellowing and absorbing into the veggies, loosing that tangy sweet magic that makes you want to eat a whole bowl of it.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;rperdue873;5;Really great! I didn’t have green onion but did not miss it. I might add golden raisins next time. Thumbs up!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;cmach;5;I made this for Easter today. I wanted to get ahead so shredded cabbage (first salting and draining), shredded the carrot and chopped peppers and mixed it together the day before. I made the dressing but kept it separate. A couple hours before serving I sliced the apples and put in veggie mix and added the dressing. I then put it in the refrigerator til time to eat. All of the adults thought it was delicious. There was a-bit too much liquid which I needed to drain - perhaps from settling in the fridge. Enjoyed with tacos!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;patsalvatore;5;Excellent as written. Next batch I made added pecans, celery (to add to the crunch factor & to use up the celery on hand. Plus a tablespoon of dried mustard pow?der to counter the sweetness level. This just just my version. The original recipe is excellent. Next time maybe raisins?
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;barbaraglenfield;5;Loved the bright flavors in this.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;craigandresen;5;This was my first attempt at homemade cole slaw. This is one of the best slaws I've ever had. I doubled the dressing amounts for a more creamy slaw.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jodiefletcher;5;We LOVE this slaw recipe. Today when I made it, I had to use dark brown sugar, and since we like slaw a little tangier, in addition to the lemon I used 2 Tab. of apple cider vinegar, and we loved it plus it thinned the dressing some. Other additions were shelled salted sunflower seeds (2 Tab.) and fresh ground pepper. Far and away our favorite slaw recipe.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kristindotson;5;This is a great recipe for any gathering. My husband and I loved it. Lots of taste and texture.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;mstree;5;Sooooo yummy! A perfect side to BBQ pork.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;bambutz;4;It's a good jumping off point, but I found it to be a little bland. I added salt, pepper, and some apple cider vinegar and that was a big improvement. Next time I might add cilantro and jalapeno.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;marcielinghahn;5;Awesome. Added the pecans and cranberries. Not necessary but good. Husband put minced jalapenos in his. If course. Little less sugar, too
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;ridingwithlarry;5;Excellent Recipe....and it is easy to make. I had a Delicious & a Jonathon apple, so I used both of them instead of the granny smith. I only have green peppers from my garden to go with my garden cabbage so used those instead of the red peppers. I also used a whole onion instead of the green onions. Nudged the mayo, & lemon juice until it was perfect. Added a pinch of salt & pepper and a dash of garlic for medicinal purposes.....I will make this again...it is droolicious....
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;laurascott;5;I like a Tsp apple cider vinegar for taste. and mix lemon juice with apples first to prevent browning. Celery instead on green onions. Great!

I add raisins, dried cranberries, celery and onion. Use both apple cider vinegar and lemon juice and add 1 tsp of salt, fresh ground pepper. I leave out the green peppers. It tastes like apple salad without nearly the heavy mayo and loads more veggie health."
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;joannmonroe;5;Very nice flavor. The peppers and onions and apples together compilment each other

f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;tjrox;5;This fruity coleslaw turned out GREAT! I didn't change anything except measurements because I made a lot of it.

f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;stephanie;5;This slaw is so refreshing and easy to make. My family was very hesitant to eat apples in a slaw but they really enjoyed this fresh dish.

I made it to take to a lunch date with a friend, and was just delighted with the blend of the various flavors, and the dressing was a perfect fit! My friend also loved it, and I left some for her to enjoy later. Now I have a new addition to my ""take-along"" recipes!!"
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;gfgal;5;My husband said that when I open my restaurant, this slaw has to be on the menu!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;chrisherald;5;This is a keeper. I followed the recipe exactly and enjoyed the salad immensely. On day two I added more fresh lemon juice and limed it more! Thanks
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;bagelbabe;1;Didn’t enjoy the dressing at all
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;karilynn;5;Such an unusual coleslaw. Perfect as is, and also easy to adjust for personal tastes. I added two tablespoons of red wine vinegar for a bit of tart. I also serve toasted almonds on the side for those who want the nut crunch. Such a good recipe. Would be awesome on a spicy pulled pork or pulled chicken sandwich!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jamesenalen;4;Added buttermilk, toasted pecans and golden raisins. Delicious!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;anthiad;5;Great change for a coleslaw recipe. Also a great way to use up veggies and apples, I added a handful of dried cranberries and a pinch of celery seed. I omitted peppers, just because I am not fond of the taste of raw bell peppers in coleslaw.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;diddydaddygrayg;5;i didn't have all the ingredients mentioned so I improvised on everything simple, the vinegar I used balsamic, the mayo sour cream, a Lil chili sauce to the eye, some mayo, seasoned salt, black pepper, Italian dressing, a Lil hot sauce, garlic powder, Badia complete, and a Lil brown sugar,
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kriscfriedli;5;Delicious! Had some Red apples in the fridge. I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar, so I substituted some Honey. I also cut my apples and let them sit in the lemon juice so they didn’t brown while I made the rest! Soo Yummy!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;stephenbarkwell;5;i added craisins
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;chrismyers;5;hopefully she does too i added 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;ladycardwell;4;This was really a wonderful salad for our Thanksgiving table. It was fresh and crisp and the dressing was just the right balance lending it a maple flavor. I made sure I put lemon juice on all the apples to keep them from browning. and in the spirit of Thanksgiving I included pecans as a wonderful fall flavour. Thanks for this wonderful recipe--- everyone absolutely loved it!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;lyncantrell;5;It's the best! I have made it at least 10 times now and everywhere I take it, it's a favorite! I made it just the way it is written!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;janagunn;5;This is a favorite every time I make it. I don't even measure anymore, but always add some salt and coarse ground pepper. This is refreshing. I also don't add quite as much sugar as it calls for.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;christineservando;5;This is the second time I made this coleslaw. The first time everybody raved and asked for recipe! I am making pork sliders and thought of this apple slaw. I made it according to original, using yellow bell pepper for sweetness and different color. I added 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar for more acid to cut the sweetness. Awesome!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jackieostroot;5;Love this coleslaw without any changes!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;ruth;5;We love this it is one of my family favorites
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;leanncurtis;5;I will and have made it again. Perfer two green apples and only one green onion though.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;patty;5;Definitely will make it again! I put doubled the lemon juice and put it over the sliced apples before combining them with the slaw and they were still not brown 3 days later and the slaw was delicious. I used angle hair slaw and added 2 bags with other other ingredients the same. Next time I will try regular shredded cabbage mix.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;cindy;5;This is only fast and so easy to make but it is spot on! I only kept out the brown sugar...it is sweet enough.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;michelle;4;I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out well. It had a little too much bell pepper for both my husband and myself and I thought the dressing was a tad on the sweet side. Next time I will only use 1/2 of the bell pepper, cut back on the brown sugar (maybe 1/4 cup), and use salt to get some of the water out of the veggies before assembling the slaw as it did get rather watery the day after I made it. This is a good base recipe to start and I will just play with the dressing to make it more to my liking.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;davemcintyre;5;Superb!! We added a handful of craisens as well - fantastic!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;dabeave92;4;I changed from the red bell pepper to the smaller peppers and used one red, one orange and one yellow. The colors popped and it was a great hit at my Mother's Day luncheon! Delicious dish.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;somgriffin;3;I found the combination of apple, pepper and scallion with the cabbage was quite effective and fresh tasting -- I read that some reviewers did not care for this combination, but I would encourage you to give it a try . After reading the other reviews, and consulting other slaw dressing recipes, I decreased the sugar to 2 tbsp and the slaw was PLENTY sweet. Given that brown sugar has its own assertive flavor on top of the sweetness, I believe the amount of sugar called for in the recipe would really overwhelm the salad to the point of ruin. I would like to rate this recipe higher: it was actually a nice side dish when made with significantly less sugar than called for. If I have reason to make it again, I'll probably go with just one tablespoon of sugar.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;dawnellagaede;5;We absolutely love this coleslaw recipe! We are very picky about coleslaw. This one is so simple to make and is a hit!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;sharon1130;5;No changes!! It’s delicious!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;antoinette;5;I made a variation with red and green cabbage. Added cranberries. The dressing was AWESOME!!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;teresa;5;Everyone loves this coleslaw!!!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;donnamoorewhiting;4;Instead of brown sugar I used organic coconut palm sugar. my mother is a diabetic and this was a great alternative to her usual coleslaw.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;katrinajahnpapatriantafyllou;4;"Delicious. Made it as is; it was crunchy and the apples added a fun sweetness. I’d accompanied a summer grill out. It also made a TON of salad so I’d cut the recipe in half next time for only 4 adults"
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;traceybedford;5;It was a hit. My son will now eat cole slaw. I didn't bother with the red pepper or green onions (didn't have them in the house), but I threw in some cranberries and slivered almonds, and added some bacon pieces to the leftovers to change it up a bit for the next day.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;chattykathy;5;I love this slaw! It's even better the next day. It's a colorful addition to a buffet and everyone seems to like it. I did use less sugar than called for.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jmeyerc;5;this slaw is totally delicious. I love the Apple in it and I will be making it again. Thanks for sharing this recipe.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;terry;4;Very good, I recommend making a day ahead of serving to give the flavors time to marry.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;mariagonzalezcanizales;5;My husband hates coleslaw but this one... well it's going to be a favorite at home. Thanks!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;suzannebotelho;4;Good. Family didn’t like the bell pepper, however. Loved the combination with the apples.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;annette;5;This coleslaw was delicious! I received alot of compliments! I excluded the green onions, but I will be making this again! I added pecans also.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;territivis;5;Very good. I was surprised even my picky husband ate it as well as my son. I switched out red peppers for yellow (red gives me heartburn) and my son was a bit surprised as I rarely has tried peppers but still ate it!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;ladykat;5;The first time I made this I changed the brown sugar to maple syrup. It was awesome! The second time I made it I was out of grannie smith apples so I used 2 fuji apples and added raisins. It was just as good! Love this recipe!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;gervsue;4;I followed the recipe and found it easy to make and very good.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;greenthumb;5;Fantastic and easy! I skipped the peppers and green onions, as I had none. I followed another's advice and added a sprinkling of sunflower seeds. A definite keeper!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;cariannediodati;5;This is a perfect recipe the way it is!! Definitely one of the best ones I’ve found.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;terriep;2;Didn’t care for it. Bland
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;sassy;4;I found the dressing a little sweet for my tastes, but the rest of the ingredients were perfect. Although I made a few of my own modifications, 1 tbsp ea. Dijon, cider vinegar then salt/pepper to taste, make this recipe as the author intended. Everyone loved it and most important, it’s almost a 5 star recipe!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;sally;5;Apple coleslaw was a big hit over Memorial Day w/e! I should have either shaved the cabbage finer or diced it ( the scallions ) added a sassy punch everyone loved this sweet/sassy dressing!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;cyndeevalencia;5;Delicious , no onions or peppers and added a little celery seed. I also doubled the dressing.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;rachael;5;Outstanding easy recipe! Used bagged shredded coleslaw mix, then followed recipe. Added additional cider vinegar , 1/4 tsp celery seeds, and seasoned salt to taste to the dressing. Mixed really well. Let it sit covered in refrigerator for a couple of hours. Topped with freshly toasted almond slices.... SPOT ON! Very very good!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;diannemannheimer;4;This was “pretty good”. I should have read the reviews first. It is a bit too sweet and I used Splenda Brown sugar blend and only 2.5 Tablespoons. I like red bell pepper and green onions. When I serve this I will add salt and pepper.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;tarab1;5;Super delish! I used less brown sugar and added some apple cider vinegar. Best slaw I've ever had!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;davevan;3;It's ok - how can you go wrong with chopped cabbage and shredded carrot. But the dressing wasn't my favorite.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;charm;4;This is a pretty good coleslaw. I like the addition of bell peppers and apples. I'm thinking about adding a fresh jalapeno next time. We'll see. I did cut the sugar in half and this was still plenty sweet. That is my excuse for only giving the recipe 4 stars. Way too much sugar. I used this with some shredded beef to make tacos today. It was very good. I did cut the sugar again. I also added a few dashes of Chipotle Tabasco and a jalapeno.

f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;scywalker68;5;We loved this coleslaw. I left out the bell pepper and onion as suggested by others.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;mollybragg;4;I liked this coleslaw, omitted lemon juice, added 3 tablespoons cider vinegar, chopped pecans and some dried cranberries. Turned out really good.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jibberish;4;Quick and easy to prep. Left out pepper and onion, added dried cranberries. Used juice from 1 lemon - 1/2 went into dressing and 1/2 on apples to prevent browning. Made 3 hrs before serving. Hubby really enjoyed it and has asked me to keep the recipe for the future
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;coachjen;5;This salad was excellent. I increased the lemon in the dressing, added more apple, and topped with pomegranate and walnuts. Also tried sprinkling with cinnamon the next day and it was very nice!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kasiesuderman;5;Nice, cool and crisp with a creamy dressing. Served it with the Blackened Salmon Fillets from this site and it was the perfect balance to the hot and spicy fish.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;cltncook;5;"Very good! Changed the preparation steps as follows: Made dressing first in a measuring cup for easy measuring, less cleanup, and so sugar could dissolve while preparing the rest of the salad; chopped apples and tossed in 2 Tbs. of lemon juice in large bowl; then chopped and added rest of vegetables to bowl and tossed with the dressing. Added 1 Tbs. of apple cider vinegar to dressing in addition to the 1 Tbs. of lemon juice called for, but will use white wine vinegar next time. Will also use granulated sugar next time. While this was a colorful, tasty salad, I felt the brownness from the dressing gave it an unappetizing look and detracted from its beautiful color. The white sugar and clear vinegar will solve this problem next time. Will make again. Prepared with coleslaw mix to make it easy."
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;missasue;3;Left out the onions. It tasted a bit on the sweet side and not as creamy as normal coleslaw. It was okay for something different, but not my favorite thing.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;mirandamom;4;This is good, although when I added lemon juice to taste it ended up being a lot of lemon juice. I think this needs a touch of heat, so next time I'll add a minced, seeded chili, or maybe swap in some radish for the green onions.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;judylemaster;5;Crunchy, tasty and healthy, especially if you use low fat mayo in the dressing. I will make this again and share with others.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;evengailbowmanbowman;5;This was a excellent recipe it was a great salad not so much a coleslaw I did add a splash of lime juice to the dressing it woke up this excellent salad
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jercan;5;I have made it 3 times in the last 3 weeks! Made it as directed- family & friends love it
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;miira1;4;Made the salad as per directions but ended up adding some apple cider vinegar, salt and pepper to temper the sweetness otherwise too sweet in my opinion but great base to work with!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;zubaidaamatullah;5;This is a good basic recipe. I did improvise a bit. I had only half a head of cabbage and so I just used half of everything else. I didn't have green onions so I used half a red onion, which was very nice. MashaAllah I made my own mayo and I decided to add walnuts. With these few changes the recipe reminded me of my mothers back in the day. Alhamdullilah It was a big hit with my wonderful husband! MashaAllah!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;glynisthemenace;5;"One of my favorite slaw recipes! If you don't put in the onions and the red pepper, you're missing out! People have different preferences regarding the sweetness so add a little brown sugar at a time to the dressing and get it to your taste. The only thing I did differently was - I sprinkled the chopped apples with ""Fruit Fresh"" so they were sure not to turn brown. (This is in addition to the lemon juice). Even better the second day!!"
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;yvettebenford;5;I love this recipe it has restaurant-quality I will make it over and over again. I really recommend this recipe to anyone. I added about an eighth of a teaspoon of cayenne pepper for some heat. This is the best coleslaw I ever had and I've never had apples in coleslaw before.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;dawninmonkton;5;This was excellent. I've now made it twice in the past two weeks. I followed the recipe, only omitting the peppers because of an allergy. I used two honeycrisp apples, because those are my favorite and always on hand. I wanted to stick to the recipe as much as possible to judge for myself on any changes, but based on reviews and not being a fan of too sweet, I just used a light hand on the brown sugar and a heavy hand on the mayo. I also squeezed lemon juice on the vegetables before tossing, then also added the lemon juice to the dressing the first time. I was out of lemons and low on juice the second time. I have to say, I preferred it with the extra lemon juice. Excellent. As a non-meat eater with lots of food allergies, this will be a keeper for me. Thank you!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;julie;5;I really don't enjoy slaw but made for my family. It has a really good mix of flavors. I left out onions and will leave apple peel on next time for color. Very good!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;caseythomson;4;Nice light salad that tastes great
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;meg;5;This was delicious! It was even great the next day, and we got more than 6 generous servings from this recipe.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;marg;4;It is a nice twist for a change to traditional coleslaw. I followed the recipe as given. It was good. I would make it again.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;tberkley;4;I'm not a coleslaw fan but this looked intriguing and I needed something to use up a half-head of cabbage. I didn't have a Granny Smith apple so I just used two Gala apples. I used about twice the lemon juice called for because the dressing was too sweet for our taste. I added a dash of salt, which I think enhanced the other flavors. This makes a beautiful slaw.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;fva5150;3;I made it exactly like the recipe and it was good but not great.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;michellemcaninch;4;This was a fantastic recipe. I did change it a bit by adding in honey instead of brown sugar and I only put in 1/4 cup instead of 1/3 cup. It was still delicious!!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;abbyz2000;5;I used a bag of coleslaw in place of the cabbage and carrots. Used light mayo and added raisins and craisins. Love it, will definitely make it for company and pot lucks. My 6 yr old asked for seconds, which says A LOT! Update: I made it for a superbowl party and it was a hit. I even increased the veggies but not the dressing.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;mousielove;5;Definitely a keeper and I've made it more than once now. I've also used it on other veggie salads, too but my first choice is for this exact recipe, made as-is. Thanks for a terrific recipe. *Update* May 2017. I have made this numerous times and recently, started using bagged slaw sold at the market for easy prep. That takes 1/4 cup of mayonnaise, 1 T. lemon juice, 2 T. brown sugar. I leave the rest of the ingredients the same. When first mixed, it doesn't look wet enough but the cabbage, apples, etc. weep and it's fine.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;amyconnellmcgrath;5;This is my all time favorite slaw! So delish and easy to make.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;shannonporcellini;5;I received lots of compliments when I made this for a large family gathering. I used my food processor and it was quick. I omitted carrots (I was roasting heirloom carrots, so I didn't want to include more), used both green and red cabbage, and added half a small cooking onion, also sliced in the food processor. I used homemade mayo and brown sugar splenda, along with the lemon juice for the dressing. It was wonderfully sweet, and tangy.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;carriehorejs;5;Refreshingly delicious! I only used two tablespoons of brown sugar and it was plenty sweet for me. I wasn't sure about the red bell pepper ingredient, but it was perfect!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;bonnieoshea;5;just made this and we thought it was wonderful. As others did I tossed cut apples in with lemon juice then mixed into rest of cabbage mixture. Also used a bit less mayo than asked for, halved brown sugar, and added a tablespoon or two of cider vinegar ( to taste) . Awesome side dish!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;liv4eal;5;I loved this recipe that hearken's back to my childhood. I've made this recipe with tender Napa Cabbage which is great for those that have a bit of trouble digesting regular green cabbage. It turned out beautifully. I added about a tsp. of caraway seeds and a generous tbsp. of liquid honey instead of the brown sugar mixed with the mayo. I cannot eat onions so substituted shredded fennel and the grated zest of a lime. I used the juice of 1/2 a lime instead of lemon. Making again today with green cabbage and adding 1/4 cup of raisins garnished with walnuts.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;asianink;5;great recipe, 1/2 the ingredients, only 1 T of brown sugar, added 1T of apple cider like others suggested. I cut my 11 granny smith into match sticks, added 1 Serrano pepper and toasted almonds. Big yum
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;lindahoniball;5;Excellent. However I omitted the carrots
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;georginaabent;4;Cut brown sugar to 1/4 cup but still a little too sweet for my taste. Otherwise, delicious and nutritious!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;corrie46;5;A really great dressing! Different than the usual, a bit on the sweet side but very yummy with the addition of apples!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;shae;5;For a cole slaw, this deserves five stars. I loved the crunchy ingredients, they blended well together taste wise. If you're doubling the dressing, it will be sweeter than you probably want. Measured out all the chopped ingredients and the dressing amount was just about perfect.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;dd9101;5;Made it exactly as written. Excellent. The best cole slaw I have ever tasted. My fiance actually asks for me to make this.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;sweetpea;5;I was wary of the ingredients in the dressing for this recipe but I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it was wonderful. I couldn't imagine that brown sugar and mayo would be good together but there truly were. I have to say it was better the day it was made than it was a day or two later. I have decided the next time I make it (and there will be a next time soon) I am going to keep the cabbage, onion, and pepper separate from the apples and dressing and mix them together the morning of the day I want to have it for lunch or maybe mix it at lunch time at work just before eating it. It's such a wonderful combination of flavors. I doubled the dressing the first time because it seemed dry but it turned out way over dressed so I will not double it the next time because I had a lot of liquid sitting in the bottom of the bowl and it would have been better without that.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;spyon;5;It is so delicious !My daughter had 4 or 5 helpings!I recommend it.??
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;padunky;5;Oh yeah, this is good! My husband liked it very much. I will decrease the amount of brown sugar and I did take the advice about making the dressing first and let set it stand, so the brown sugar would desolve, while putting the slaw together. Of course I did as many others and used the prepaged slaw mix, sliced walnuts and dried cranberries. I definitely will make again!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;macfadden;3;This was not really to my taste. I did like the inclusion of apple, but I left out half of the sugar and still found it too sweet.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;roycebernal;4;I am not a big personal fan of slaw but I love this recipe and have made it several times now. I did make some changes due to my personal tastes. I am kinda picky. I used the bagged tri color slaw. It works good and saves time on prep for the cabbage and carrots. I also julienned the apples to follow along with the shape of the cabbage and carrots. I omitted the bell peppers since I do not favor them and only used the green onion as a garnish. I also followed the suggestion of other reviewers and garnished with dried cranberries. They add a very nice touch. I also stirred it up once an hour for the first few hours before serving. For the best flavor, let it set in the fridge at least 4 hours. Its a great side dish for bbqs and potlucks, tastes great and keeps well. I have yet to have left overs. It has been made a permanent recipe in my files.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;scully;5;Added fresh dill. Family loved it and want me to bring again to next family dinner.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;pbsoo;5;"I needed a quick salad, so used a bag of already chopped cole slaw mix with carrots. Saved time and was very tasty. It's my ""go to"" for potlucks."
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;templebuilding;4;Delicious. Just made it. I replaced the mayo with greek yogurt and will probably add walnuts, but as is it is delicious! A sweet salad if you will:)
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;loricakes;5;It tastes great! I think the nutrition info might be off a tad. I got 11 half cup servings instead of six, which would dramatically decrease the carbs and calories. I even did 1/4c sugar instead of the 1/3. It's still very sweet and I think next time I will do even less.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;emily85;5;Made this for a potluck and it was a hit! I'm definitely making it again soon.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kathyhagedornmindes;5;Fantastic! My small tweaks were 1/2 the sugar and I didn't peel the apples. It was plenty sweet. I also added sunflower seeds right before serving. Soo good.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;joanneforster;5;Left out onions, it was delicious.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;happyinthekitchen;5;One of the most delicious things I've made in awhile - totally delicious, thanks very much for posting!!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;courtney;5;Made it without the pepper but otherwise exactly like the recipe and it turned out fantastic. If you like a creamier coleslaw make double the dressing but I thought it was great the way it was.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;carolq;4;We liked this just fine. The dressing was a little sweeter, but quite tasty.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;caverli;5;Very good, though it won't keep for more than a couple days. I followed others' advice and added a little vinegar. However, Balsamic was not the way to go, for while it was sweet and tasty, it quickly tainted everything a shade of brown.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;alwaysbetty;4;This got good feedback on Easter Sunday. I highly suggest reading the reviews AND choosing a flavor addition of your liking. I made it as written and found I needed salt and pepper to give it some flavor. Next time I will salt the coleslaw and add vinegar.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;glenniejunkin;5;This is EXCELLENT & easy. Didn't change a thing. Don't be a hater about the onion! It complements the sweetness of the dressing & apples.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;elizabethday;5;Very delicious! I added a pair and some grapes, even the kids ate it.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;shankandyank;5;"I gave this 5 stars for the base of the sauce and how easy this I to make. I did not have all the ingredients, here's what I did different; Used dole bagged coleslaw- already cut up and has the carrots in it. I didn't use the green onion or red pepper. And I used cider vinegar instead of the lemon juice! Awesome!!! Will add sunflower seeds next time too!"
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;lucysfriend;5;I tried this recipe for the first time and absolutely loved it. Because I love green onions I doubled that part of the recipe...otherwise everything was the same and this will now be my go to slaw recipe. Such an interesting group of flavors...not the boring slaw that is often just a barely noticed part of a meal.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;rachel;3;This recipe was just okay and a great base to start with but I would not serve this recipe without some adjustments. I left out the onion, and instead substituted toasted pecans and some raisins. The dressing is very sweet so I cut the sugar in half (adding the raisins also added sweetness). You can use mixed green and purple cabbage if you prefer, and it gives the slaw a really pretty color. The lemon juice is absolutely essential, and really brings the flavors all together.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;francie63;5;What a tasty slaw. Nice change of pace. Squirted lemon juice on apples after I chopped them (in addition to lemon in the dressing.) Added salt and pepper too and a handful of chopped peanuts. Serving tonight with burgers and brats.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;nekomom;5;Left out the onions and bell peppers. Amazing will make again but add pecans and raisins
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;judithkerr;5;What a winner! I was so surprised that I had everything in the frig to make this. Nice colors and great taste!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;sonialacroix;5;I don't like coleslaw but this one is yummy. Had some more for snack
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;angelacrowpenny;4;very good and easy to make
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;michelle;5;I made this using Hellmann's Balsamic Mayonnaise and a couple teaspoons of vinegar and it was amaaaaaazing. This was a huge hit, and I think the Balsamic mayo along with the tartness of the apples made the dish. Note: It probably made more like 8 servings.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;christythompson;5;OMG this is the BEST cole slaw I have ever had!!!!!!! Did not change one thing about this recipe, and everybody LOVED it!!!!! Thank you so much!!!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;cthecow;5;SO GOOD! However, I would have rather had more precise quantity measurements for the apples, carrots and onions. I think I used a total of 1½ to 2 c. apples, ½ c. carrot and ¼ to ? c. green onion, though, and absolutely LOVE this recipe and so did my guests. It's a keeper - wouldn't change a thing from here on out and will make it over and over. Thanks so much for sharing it.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;ladyslew;5;This has become a family favorite. Even people who normally don't like cole slaw like this.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;rosealcorn;5;What a wonderful recipe. It was easy to make and delicious! My five-year-old, an exceptionally picky eater, helped make and eat it. We will definitely make this again!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jessicawatsongloss;5;Delicious!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kristenpoe;4;Dressing seemed like it needed something more.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;janeguzauskasruby;5;I was a bit wary of the complexity of flavors, but I tried the recipe as written. Turned out delicious. I think the slaw sauce was key. I spiced it up with California Seasoning Salt (Pepper, salt, garlic, lemon zest). Using the freshest veggies also helps. The apples and mayo reminded me of Waldorf salad but so much better! I will use this recipe instead of the traditional Waldorf recipe. Oh yeah--one tip: make sure you toss apples in lemon juice before adding rest of ingredients. It'll prevent browning if your slaw is being stored for a few days. I paired this slaw with cayenne spiced tilapia.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;laura;5;don't need to be exact or even have all the ingredients. the basic idea of the recipe is great and most variations are delicious as well.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;ladybetsu;5;One of the best coleslaws ever! Didn't have any carrots and added a half teaspoon of poppy seeds. What a wonderful recipe! Could add pecans or walnuts or sunflower seeds, if desired. My family loves this slaw and it doesn't require a speck of salt! It's all good. Thank you for a real keeper!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;vino;5;Perfect, always have apples and cabbage in the fridge. Everyone loved it!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;caterina;5;Love this recipe!! Simple but so delicious and pretty too. Added sun flower seeds for additional crunch.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;carolshorterhicks;4;"This was good but not great. I found that the dressing lacked some ""zip"" so added about 1 tablespoon cider vinegar and just a dash of salt. That seemed to do it. Was a good salad for a potluck."
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;sherryfromottawacanada;5;YUMMY! After chopping the apples, mixed them with 2 TBSP lemon juice (prevents browning) and did not add any more to dressing. May reduce brown sugar next time as we found it a little sweet
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;brooksidebistro;4;This was good and healthy! Subbed 3 cups slaw mix for shredded cabbage, subbed 1/2 cup toasted almonds for carrots, and added 1 tsp. Apple Cider vinegar. Very pleasant, quick, crunchy and healthy. Kids didn't HATE it (that gives me hope) & hubs liked it (highly unusual response from him on my new creations...LOL ). I will make again, as it is nice for the hot Florida temps...give it a try...you will be happy to have a change!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;amabel;4;I liked it.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;trishthedish;5;My husband is a cole slaw snob, but he loved this cole slaw recipe. I made it as written except I took a few hints from other reviewers. I tossed the apples in the lemon juice to prevent premature browning of the apples. I also added a couple of tablespoons of sunflower seeds to add a bit of crunch. And I also used some premade cole slaw from a bag and added some carrots. I will make this again.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;diannepricerhoades;5;This is a keeper. I doubled the dressing and added more cabbage. It was so refreshing. I also put 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 Splenda to cut back on calories. It is scrumptious.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;rene;5;I just served it to company tonight and they loved this salad. Forget plain-old-coleslaw. It is the perfect dish to bring to a gathering. If they try it they will love it. Rene
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;brenda;2;This dressing is way to sweet! I had to double the mayo & add some cider vinegar just to make it palatable!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;pearlosby;5;I really enjoyed this. Will make this again
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;tenderbelle61;4;I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe. Very refreshing and nice taste.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;eepie;4;This was pretty good. P liked it a lot more than I did. There's a good chance I'll make this again when I have cabbage to use up.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;nicoleplummer;5;I'm not a fan of cole slaw, but had a head of cabbage to use. I tried this recipe and LOVED it, my whole family did. I didn't have red pepper and added broccoli because I had it on hand. This is definitely a new favorite!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;cmoore799;4;I used this recipe as a basis for a work pot luck. I simply used a bag of coleslaw, apples (golden & red delicious & granny smith) a little salt & pepper and top with strawberry salad dressing (that gave it more flavor) wish I had let it sit overnight to sort of marinate the flavors
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;sheric123;5;This was delish! I didn't measure a thing, just put ingredients in until it tasted the way I wanted it to! I used Agave syrup instead of brown sugar, worked great. I also mixed broccoli slaw into it, gave it more crunch.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;lace;5;This is a great change for cole slaw. I left out the peppers and reduced the sugar but this was indeed refreshing. For those who want it a bit tangy, add a splash of vinegar.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;groze;5;Quick and easy! Yum!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;nanciemartin;5;I just loved everything about this recipe andim not a big fan of cole slaw. I initially made it for my husband but I think I ate more than him! Loved the apples
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;glorytenneykosmatka;5;Didn't have the green onion or pepper so substituted 2 ribs of celery and put sliced vegetables and apples in food processor with dressing ingredients processed redistributed ingredients and reprocessed again for a finely chopped easy coleslaw. Incredibly good!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;caroline;5;Delicious and light!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;smindel;4;It was great .. Although I did add a little more mayo and used apple cider vinegar as well it gave it a lighter flavor. But over all the base of the recipe was great!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;zalupster;5;5 Stars! My fussy guests loved it! Use Honeycrisp apples for the red ones
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;laurances;5;followed recipe closely used red cabbage instead of green. Still came out great
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jeepmom29;5;This was so quick and easy. I did add dried cranberries and celery seed to the mix as well. With the fresh picked apples of the fall this was a hit with my husband and myself. I will be sharing this recipe with my daughters!!'
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;diamondgirlamanecer;5;This is a very tasty salad. I didn`t use so much brown sugar, just to taste. And I used 2 cups red cabbage and 1 cup a regular cabbage. Turned out wonderful, everybody wanted for more.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jenholcomb;4;Just made this!! Came out awsome. Used garden fresh cabbage and apples. Amped it up on the apples for extra sweetnss. Although if it wasnt fot the parsley I added and the pepper add it might need some extra color.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;orchidblossom;5;I omitted the bell pepper and green onion because my kids don't like it, and it was very good. My 4 year old ate 2 servings. :)
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;mom;4;I have made a similar coleslaw for many years but I always use apple cider vinegar in the dressing. I never use green peppers - they tend to overwhelm the apple taste. And I use red onion.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;cervonil;5;This was delicious. I can't think of what could make it better. I did add a little salt and pepper to taste.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jenniferbaker;5;YUMMMM! We loved this! I think next time I'll add some cranberries like others have suggested, but this goes so well with pork. I'll definitely make it again!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;redjenni24;5;This was super simple and easy to improvise. I made it with white onions and apple cider vinegar instead of lemon juice because it's what I had on hand, and it still turned out great! Next time I think I'll do less onion, but it's a tasty recipe.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;ldavido;5;really one of my favorite cole slaws ever
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;shieldsk;4;The guests at lunch thought this rocked, even though I cut the cabbage into hunks instead of strands. The apple adds a surprising sweetness that the sparse dressing did not. Try it.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;cyndigustavson;5;Made this a few weeks ago and it was great! It does make a lot, so hope you have a lot of people to feed.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;valeriegraysmith;5;Thought this was really good... Liked the addition of brown sugar rather than white... All it needed was some salt and pepper to taste! Was perfect with my Chicken Cordon Bleu sandwiches and cajun french fries last night!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jfl;5;This is a great recipe. Took other reviewers advice with removing some of the liquid from the cabbage so that it wasn't so watery as well as adding lemon to the apples so they didn't brown. It came out great, even better the 2nd day when all the flavors had time to blend. Paired it with Chipotle Crusted Pork Tenderloin from All Recipes and it was a great combination of sweet and spicy.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;pattyg;4;Nice change from the norm! Started with a bag of cole slaw mix (had the carrot in it), used small green bell pepper, diced purple onion, added extra lemon juice and threw in a handful of roasted & salted sunflower seeds.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;stacie;4;Good and easy. I used less green onions because it seemed like alot. I rinsed my apples in lemon water first. Still good enough to eat 3 days later.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kristiedixon;4;My husband, who doesn't care for cole slaw, actually ate this one and said he liked it! Of course, my grandsons both loved it! It was really tasty, a lot of fresh flavors. I didn't like the use of so much brown sugar in the dressing, so I think the next time I will cut that down considerably.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jenipank;4;I took this to a BBQ and got a lot of compliments
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;angchick;5;I omitted the pepper and green onion. Very good.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;supermom1966;5;I did not use the peppers or onion, I just used extra cabbage mix (I used a 16 oz bag). Next time I will try adding nuts and perhaps craisins. My kids loved it too
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kirstenfinnigan;5;This was excellent! And very easy with a pre-shredded bag. I put this together while at a cabin with limited supplies. Next time, I'll try it with Granny Smith and might like it even better!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;tricia;4;Just made this. My husband was blown away. At las,t a new cole slaw recipe that really is good. I did use 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 mayo. I'm thinking any root vegetable or hard fruit would work.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;briancliffordii;5;This was awesome, I added some diced jalapeños for some heat!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;pattispragginswinfield;5;This cole slaw recipe is really really good. I made it for our first cookout of the season and it was gone in minutes.

f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;karens;3;I thought it was ok. Hubby didn't like it at all. Not that special
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kim;5;I tried this recipe and my fiancé loved it. He's not big on salads but asked me to fix this salad more often. I did not include bell pepper or an onion. I forgot them when I went grocery shopping. I used vinegar instead of lemon juice and the salad was refreshing.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;lainie44;5;I made this for a Memorial Day party and it went over very well. Like others, I added dried cranberries and sliced almonds to the top of the salad as well as seedless red grapes for color. I also added some fresh cutup oranges and that was great too! I did not add the onions or pepper.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;nancy;5;I have made this several times, always a big hit. Last time I did not have any lemon juice so I squeezed a whole lime on........perfect!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;mrsanderson84;4;My husband absolutely loved this dish. To me though it was missing some sweetness.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;annama;5;We loved this recipe! I added sultanas and omitted red peppers, simply because I forgot to buy some... it was good after 2 hours and even better the day after. I used vegan mayo, which is amazing and cholesterol-friendly, enriched with ginger, and it complimented the other flavours. I may add that it looks pretty too!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;susieq;5;My family loves this recipe. I also love reading all of the comments and will defintiely try the salt on the cabbage and soaking the apples in lemon water. The only thing I add is a generous sprinkling of celery sede to add dimension to the flavor. Thanks Aunt mamie for giving me a new recipe to add to the family favorites!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;valleygirl;5;As far as cole slaw goes, this is a pretty traditional slaw, minus the brown sugar. I left it out because I don't like sweet slaws. I followed the directions, other than that. Enjoyed the addition of apple and red bell. Will make again.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;debrariemcutlip;5;Never liked Cole slaw until I tried this recipe. Taste fabulous. Only thing I changed was to add a little more lemon in the dressing and I had some parsnip left over that I added.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jennhyatt;5;Delicious..as is! I didn't change a thing. Thanks for the great recipe!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kasia777;5;Had some cabbage to finish up and found this recipe. This is delish!! I can just eat the whole bowl. It is light and fresh
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kristyhh;5;I almost always stick to the exact recipe the first time I try it. The only time I do not is if there is an ingredient I do not care for. When I decided to make this, I did not realize I was out of some key ingredients. I made it anyway making adjustments. I used a coleslaw mix and omitted the carrot. I did not have any bell peppers, green onions, granny smith apples, or mayo. So...I chopped two tablespoons of yellow onion, used a stalk of celery, and two Braeburn apples. Instead of mayo, I used Miracle Whip Light. The results were pretty good. I believe when I make this again following the actual recipe, I will be in love with it.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;wisera;3;Good simple recipe, I think I will try with less cabbage (1/2 as much) and more apple (1.5-2 times as much) next time. The dressing seemed perfect.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jlhclwh;5;My family loves this recipe. It is fantastic exactly as directed. However I usually make it with homemade mayonnaise and raw honey instead of the brown sugar. You can also substitute unflavored greek yogurt for the mayo and that is very good as well. Goes perfectly with BBQ dishes like pulled pork. Definitely a five star recipe and so easy!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;goingup2jc;5;I am SO surprised! I got a head of cabbage in my CSA box and didn't know what to do with it. I've never liked cole slaw, ever. EVER. But, I didn't want to waste it so I bit the bullet and picked a high-rated recipe, sure that I would end up throwing it out after tasting it. I almost gave up when I was chopping the cabbage because it sure did smell nasty. Anyway after I had put everything together, and tasted it, I could NOT believe it. I actually enjoyed it! Thank you for this recipe to help this first-time cabbage-try-er actually enjoy cabbage! By the way, I followed some of the reviews and used lemon juice on the apples, added pecans & dried cranberries, and a little apple cider vinegar.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;lutzflcat;5;Had my doubts how this dressing would look on the salad after mixing in the brown sugar, but not to worry, it was fine. Crunchy fresh cabbage, crisp apples, and a slightly sweet dressing resulted in a very nice salad. Welcome change from the traditional tossed green salad that I eat most of the time. Good way to welcome Fall, and I definitely will be making again.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kathrinefergusonjenkins;5;Love it. Per my personal preference, I decreased the cabbage to 2 cups and increased the apples and carrots to 3 each. The last time I made it I also added more peppers so I had orange, red and yellow ones. Very colorful and tasty. Very versatile recipe. Thank you.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;laura2979;5;I liked this recipe alot , the only thing I changed was that I omited the green onion and red pepper, and instead added 1/3 red onion and extra lemon and used agave syrup instead of brown sugar. It was sweet and crunchy and savoury all at once! I tried this recipe with walnuts and it was delicious as well!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;ladeeluck84;5;Made this with a group of friends, it was fun! Slaw is really refreshing and tasty! Only change I'd make is lessening the cabbage. We only used 1 head and it was plenty (We scaled it up to serve 20) Super easy and really good! Goes great with sloppy joes..
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;adamgaylord;4;This makes a good slaw. I recommend adding a bit more mayo. Also, this makes a ton so only double this if you're feeding an army. I added some more jalapeno, some cilantro, tomato, and onion to the leftovers and it turned into a great pico de gallo!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jeff;5;"Great recipe! Made it the first time to bring to a BBQ as a side dish; everyone raved about it which was surprising as the BBQ was great too. The dressing, which is so simple and doesn't sound good, nicely sets off the flavors and doesn't overpower. Definitely a winner!"
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;ryersae;5;Amazing. Definitely making this again.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jencopper;5;perfect with my smoked pulled pork sandwhich recipe!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;stacieseymour;5;A very nice variation on the traditional cole slaws, sweet and just a tiny bit of tang offset by the onion. Delish!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;mj;4;Even people who hate traditional cole slaw liked this.... It was a hit at my house!!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jacki;5;Phenomenal!!! I was looking for an alternative to regular coleslaw and this was a winner. So crisp, sweet, fresh - everyone loved it and requested the recipe. I have an egg-allergy son so I actually subbed egg-free mayonaise for the regular mayo but it didn't make a difference. Will be in our summer recipe file for sure.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;eminmontana;5;Couldnt stop eating this until it was gone.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kmnash1219;5;Great side!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;granolagirl;5;This turned out great, and I've used it several times already. A nice change from the typical coleslaw. I omitted the onion and it was still great.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;cyndi;5;Really good! I used a bag of 3 color slaw for the cabbage and carrot because I'm lazy. Was a big hit alongside/on Carolina BBQ I served at a party.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;ingy90;2;I liked the mix of the cabbage and apple but the dressing is sickly sweet for veggies, it ruined the whole dish. I may try the apple-cabbage mix with a more acid based dressing.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;tizzylish2003;4;Made this tonight using 2 Tbsp greek yogurt and 1 Tbsp mayo. I thought is was very refreshing and will definitely make again. I think next time I will use bagged coleslaw and add mandarin oranges.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jollean;5;This was delicious. Everyone in the family really enjoyed it.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;arleneb;5;Absolutely the best cole slaw recipe I have ever tasted. Wouldn't change a thing. Arlene Butler Alberta, Canada
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;happychef;5;I cook for a group of people and they LOVED this Apple Slaw way more than a traditional cole slaw. Thanks for sharing!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;michellerothkiva;4;"UPDATE: MY NEIGHBOR SNEAKED A LITTLE LEFTOVER SLAW FOR HERSELF (HENCE I BROUGHT HOME AN EMPTY DISH). HER HUSBAND ENDED UP EATING HER ""STASH"" FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING HAHA! Yum! What a nice change of pace from the usual mayonnaise-laden coleslaw! My hubs and I were invited to a neighborhood cookout this past weekend. I took this as our ""dish"" to contribute and brought nothing home!!! As many others did, I too subbed a pre-packaged coleslaw mix for chopped cabbage. Because I wanted some color, I used equal parts coleslaw / shredded red cabbage. The packaged mix I purchased didn't have many carrots in it, so I added a couple generous handfuls of matchstick cut ones (found near the coleslaw in my grocers produce section). My final change was tossing my cut apples in a tiny bit of lemon juice to prevent them from browning. Although this turned out pretty well, I do regret not ""sweating"" my cabbage (the bulk of all vegetables are comprised mostly of water, ESPECIALLY cabbage, cucumber and eggplant). By the end of the evening, a considerable amount of liquid had collected in the bottom of my bowl and my red cabbage ""bled"" a bit (if that makes any sense...). NOTE: DO NOT LEAVE OUT THE BELL PEPPER OR GREEN ONION! Both add a bit of savory to this otherwise sweet dish and are FANTASTIC complements. Thanks SO much for sharing this unique, summer-appropriate recipe, Aunt Mamie! I'll be adding this to my recipe box for sure. :-)"
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jag;4;Good. The apples need to be finely chopped so the flavors can meld.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;mountaintopmama;5;I was surprised by how good this was. I added a little more mayo with one pkg of angle hair slaw. Also had to add a touch of salt. It was really good!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;elball;4;Great recipe. My SIL made this for a family dinner. Used one Granny Smith apple and left out the red apple. Also added more bell pepper. Use only one green onion or else the slaw will taste like green onion.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;coopercook;5;Made this with greek yogurt instead of the mayo so it would be even lighter, and it was great. Next time I'll use a little less sugar because the yogurt doesn't balance it as well as the mayo would.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;ppk;5;Fabulous, won't make regular creamy coleslaw again unless for over hot dogs & hamburgers. Didn't have green onion so used a little red onion & did make things even easier by using a bag of coleslaw instead of purchasing everything. I like Kraft Coleslaw dressing & had that on hand so used it instead. The crunch of the apples & the color of the pepper & red onion made it appealing.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;dedwin;5;great for cookout side
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;loren;5;Just made this apple cole slaw for my family and they just loved it. It has a great tang and sweetness and crunch! Definitely will be making this again for the summer. Just nice side dish to cut through the bbq and meats.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;saerick;5;This is soooo good. If you like cole slaw you'll love this recipe! I just used a package of cole slaw mix and added a sliced green apple and red like the recipe calls for and then added some dried cranberries. The sweet dressing is delicious. (I left out the onions and peppers). I'll be making this for bbq's all the time! Thanks!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;peasnsoup;5;This is amazing! I hate coleslaw, but got assigned it for a potluck and thought I'd give this a whirl. Because I don't like coleslaw I followed the ingredients list exactly - the only slight change I made was to soak the chopped apples in the lemon juice rather than just let it mix in. Everything about this recipe is delicious. Even if you don't like one or two of the components, you DO need them all and somehow they all work well together.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;bibi;5;If you are looking for a different recipe for cole slaw, you have found it. This colorful salad is almost a cross between Waldorf salad and cole slaw. The dressing is sweet, so be sure to add enough lemon juice to balance to your tastes. I followed the recipe exactly, and my husband loved it. He has a sweet tooth, so it really appealed to him. For ease of combination, and for incorporating the onions, next time I will mix the dressing in the food processor and throw in the onions, so they will become part of the dressing. A pinch of salt would be nice, too.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;lizstallermacdonald;5;I have made this recipe several times and it is always a hit. I follow the recipe as written. Everyone who has it the first time are always surprised by the apples in the salad
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;michelle;5;I never rate recipes but this one is just soooo good. Only thing I did different was less sugar other than that NOTHING!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kkimmel507;5;Awsome! Just made this dish for our BBQ tonight. I just hope there's going to be some left for my husband and son. Thank you for sharing.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;tiffanywinklekorol;5;very good. Kids love it.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;magielinebenedicto;4;Super easy to make and a fan at family get togethers :)
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;texasann;5;I have made this before and really liked it. After reading the reviews I will try salting the cabbage in a collander to get some of the moisture out. Also soaking the apples in lemon water is a great tip. I love reading the comments because you see how different everyone's taste is! Some love onions, some don't. I would never think of putting pineapple in a cole slaw, but might try it someday.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;5foot3;3;This was just okay, I did find it a bit on the sweet side and also I needed to double the ingredients for the dressing.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;ccarr67;5;Out of this world!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;beccabee;5;Just different enough to be special--followed the directions and other advice and added lemon juice to the apples before I added them to the salad to prevent browning. Omitted green onions because we didn't have any--still fabulous. Thanks!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;tania;5;I was skeptical about this because of the amount of brown sugar, but it was really good. I didn't use the red bell pepper. I liked it even better the next day!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;maryelle;5;This recipe is wonderful. I double the apple, and cut the apple pieces into fairly small chunks. The first time I made it the apple pieces were too big and fell off the fork. I also shake the apple pieces in extra lemon juice before assembly so it lasts longer without browning. Due to personal preference, I substitute bell pepper for the red pepper, and substitute some shopped celery for most of the green onion. It would be good with nuts, too. The dressing is delicious. Thanks!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;mordonez;5;This is a great slaw for those who like theirs sweet. My husband went out and got more cabbage so I could make more.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;clarissaspehl;5;I cut back on the brown sugar but only because our family never likes as much as a recipe calls for. My husband and two year old loved it. The four year old didn't like it at all and I thought it was good but needed pecans. When the husband says five stars, though, I give five stars because he doesn't just hand those out to every recipe.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;dorothydehart;3;Tooo sweet, next time I will use half the brown sugar at most. nice and crunchy though. Adding some toasted almonds or sunflower seeds adds a nice touch.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;mrsfisher0729;5;This is great! We really enjoyed it! My parents that don't really care for healthier items even liked it!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;mona;5;Very good, made it just like the receipe called for, made no changes, a do over for sure. thanks
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;phuong01;5;I love this slaw! The sweetness Is perfect for barbecues,
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;elle;4;A good cole slaw. Fresh, crisp. Very sweet. I used the packaged broccoli slaw. Will try adding a tsp of cider vinegar as other reviewers have done to cut the sweetness. Great as a wrap as well as a salad.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;gitano;4;I wasn't too sure about fruit in a coleslaw never having one before, but it turned out fabulous! The only apples I had on hand were Honeycrisp, so I did cut down on the sugar in the recipe (by half) due to the sweetness of the apple and am glad I did, coleslaw should be a wee bit tart IMO! :) I did add some raisins for a garnish, overall, will make this again! Thanks for the recipe!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;danab;5;Fantastic slaw! Now I know how my favorite restaurant slaws get that flavor I love. Family loved it: ate second and third helpings. Thanks!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;tinacarver;5;Yummy!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;julianacloud;3;Followed recipe exactly...it was good, not great...so, will use a different recipe next time.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;colormebeth;5;Very sweet/tart. Wonderful. Left out the red pepper. The dressing ingredients make the cabbage sweat so the volume of finished salad decreases by almost half when it's had time to chill. Swims in a puddle of dressing. The only change I would make is to allow time to drain it through a colandar before serving next time.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;cookiev1;5;Awesome, a little sweet and a little sour. I changed this a little...omitted the red peppers and only used 1/4 of the carrot! I paired it with the pulled pork...amazing!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;mickdee;5;Outstanding! I took this to a pot luck this summer and got raves. I halved the red pepper, just a personal thing.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jenniferross;5;This was DELICIOUS. And refreshing, and crunchy, and just wonderful. Used a little more cabbage because the dressing was sweet and went a long way, used prepackaged cabbage/carrot mix and left out the bell pepper as I am not a fan. But other than that it was awesome, and everyone loved it.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;clejen;4;This recipe is simple and delicious. I skipped the red pepper and used apple cider vinegar in the dressing, only soaking the apples in actual lemon juice prior to putting everything together. If your or someone you love (i.e. my husband) don't like the heavier mayonaise-based cole slaws, this one will be a winner. We put it on top of pulled pork sandwiches, and it was just perfect!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jen;5;Love this! I was a little hesitant to make it and it turned out great. I did use the bag slaw mix and Splenda brown sugar. Also added craisins. I will definitely make this again.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;glenmbarton;4;This recipe was the hit of the party. Paired with macaroni and cheese and crockpot honey ribs (also from allrecipes) was the perfect party menu. I used bagged coleslay mix instead of the cabbage and carrots. Cut the sugar in half and added a Tablespoon of redwine vinegar to the dressing. Followed the recommendation of putting the apples in bag with lemon juice - 2 days later and no browning. I also added dried cranberries.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;nancymorton;5;"This slaw is addictive! Everyone I have ever served it too can't stop eating it. I doubled the recipe for a crowd about 4 hours before serving; is better if you do it the day before. I use a slotted spoon to transfer the slaw to another bowl if the sauce gets runny. I also use the lemon juice on the apples as I chop them up; no trouble with browning at all, even the next day. I added a 1/2 a medium onion chopped finely instead of the 2 green onions and a few hits of red pepper sauce for an extra zing; also salt and pepper to taste. A great picnic slaw. I took this batch to a lobster roast and not a smidgen left."
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;aideen;3;This was very sweet so taste the dressing before applying!! It turned out ok with lots of adjustments tho. Made the day before, by the time we served it was looking a little dingy, apples slightly brown (I used lemon). Omitted onion & pepper, used bagged slaw mix, added crainraisins & cider vinegar. Vingegar was a good tip-thanks!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;pukkabrio;4;Delicious!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;yummyinmytummy777;5;Awesome Reciepe! It was a hit in my house i will most definetly make it again :)
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;juliarrhubin;5;awesome and very very easy. YUM!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;haileedrege;4;I made this with pork roast and it made a great side dish. A little on the sweet side, next time I will cut down on the sugar content.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;fruttidimare;2;not sure what i could've done wrong - or maybe i'm just used to a more savoury coleslaw - but this is waaaaay too sweet. essentially a dessert. that's even with only 3 tbsp of sugar, supertart apples and xtra lemon juice. took forever to make, so am not feeling too cheery. sorry - i really wanted to like this.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;liz;5;Great coleslaw recipe. I followed the recipe but used 4 cups of cabbage instead of 3, it came out great!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;massageldy;5;"made exactly as posted; doubled recipie!"
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;annlyssyj;5;This is very good slaw. I did use less sugar than called for and added a bit of vinegar and a grind of black pepper.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jene;4;A bit too sweet for me (even with Splenda brown sugar), but nice way to use up left over apples from our tree. Thanks for sharing.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;bigmommahill;5;This is really good. I added some craisins.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;tisi;5;I have made this cole slaw more times than I can count. I add toasted sunflower seeds and sometimes substitute blueberries for apples, both ways are delicious. I love the mix of sweetness and crunch. Thank you!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;lorraine;5;This is a recipe you can trust. I made it for 22 people and everyone raved. I didn't make any changes. I would suggest making it a few hours ahead to help blend the flavors. Before serving you can drain a little of the extra juices but don't drain them all because I had people who wanted it sloppy!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;sunny719;4;Very nice! I do think I would add a little cider vinegar maybe next time. I put some of the lemon juice in a bag and put my apples in that as I cut them.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kim;5;My husband loved it, but I ran out of brown sugar and used white sugar, plus Japanese mayo.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;hurdbird;4;Update: Still a solid 4 star recipe. This is so fresh and a refreshing summer salad.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;maryserafin;5;My niece made this cole slaw and this is the best slaw that I have ever eaten! I have recommended this recipe to everyone looking for a slaw recipe.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;melcmyk;4;Awesome...Everyone at our last BBQ loved this recipe. The only big change I made was adding pomegranate infused red wine vinegar. It played nicely with the apples. Love it!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;foodie78;5;this is the second time i'm making this salad. i followed directions both times. Great salad - even picky hubby likes it!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jillian;4;Great combination of crunchy and sweet! I made this a little easier and just used a bag of coleslaw mix thus eliminating the need for the grated carrot. I also opted out of the green onion and instead used a little celery. I did add a bit of seasoned salt and some fresh cracked black pepper and cut the mayo with a bit of sour cream. This definitely needs to set for a few hours before serving.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;simmonslize;5;Great...however, I omited the bell pepper and added red onion and Jalepenos, poppy seeds and a cap full of apple cider vinegar
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;greenlight;4;Great recipe! It's crunchy, sweet, and tangy! Some changes/substitutions I made: 1. I used a bag of broccoli slaw instead of the cabbage, carrots, and red pepper. 2. I don't like my coleslaw mayonnaise heavy so I used a little less than 1/3 cup mayo and slightly less brown sugar. 3. Like other reviewers, I tossed the apples in lemon juice in addition to using lemon juice in the dressing. I also added a handful of dried cranberries. 4. I used fresh lemon juice and also added so lemon zest, it made the slaw very light and refreshing!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;saraspoede;4;Left out bell pepper and onion. After chopping apples, let set in water with lemon juice, did not add juice to mixture.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;romm;5;The first time I followed this recipe exactly. It turned out very good. I did salt my cabbage first and let it sit but the bagged cabbage didn't lose any water. And I used part of the lemon juice to coat my apples so they wouldn't turn brown. When I made this the second time I used a bag of broccoli slaw and I liked the taste better. Plus I got the added benefit of more veggies. Great recipe will make this many more times. Thanks.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;shannonkreidler;4;kinda of turned saggy..
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;bridgette;5;We really enjoyed this Cole Slaw with the apples added. My husband added mayo. each time he ate it, but I enjoyed it as is!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;ray;3;This was just ok. Not our favorite cole slaw- wouldn't make this one again.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;tasiar;5;Tastes so fresh!!! Great for a summer side!!!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;cookee0303;4;Didn's add bellpeppers. Added some salt. Delish!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;mare;5;This slaw is great with spicy wings or pulled pork. I made the recipe exactly as stated and my kids who do not like cole slaw loved it. Very good thanks
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;peedee;5;Everyone loves this salad! I use Pink Lady apples, dried cranberries, and almonds, no onion or bell pepper.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;tamara;5;"When my husband saw me making this he questioned the apples, but everyone who had this at our party enjoyed it and he has said I can make it again anytime. I used a 16 oz. bag of shredded cabbage and carrots, left out the ""additional"" carrot, and followed the rest of the recipe."
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;charlenelybbert;5;loved this! great spin on the tradition cole slaw
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;dismom;5;First time I ever made cole slaw. My husband loved it said it tasted like apple bees haha I followed exactly as directed and it was yummy.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;nina517;5;Threw this together in no time, and oh.my.gosh. SO good, so light....PERFECT for a summer cookout. thank you!!!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;chichibird;5;Just finished making this dish. Of course, I have to taste as I go and it's sooooo good! I know it will be even better tomorrow. Tastes like summer. Thanks!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;az;4;Yummy! I use miracle whip due to allergies, so I cut back on the sugar, increased the lemon juice a tad, and then added a sprinkle of coleman's mustard (This is my standard substitution). I had a few fresh radishes out of my garden that I also added. Thanks for a winning recipe! As it was I think I would cut the sugar just a bit more - maybe 1/3 of what's called for, but that's my personal preference.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jessica;4;A nice change of pace from typical coleslaw with bright colors and great veggies!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kymskitchen;3;I followed the recipe with the exception of the carrot. I enjoyed it, but others did not. Nice variation on cole slaw.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;thelees;5;Excellent! Made this for a Scentsy party and everyone loved it!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;lyje;5;Delicious with bbq pork sandwiches. Added 1 tbsp vinegar as suggested and added slice almonds. So refreshing!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;mariail;5;This was very tasty and easy to make. I didn't use all of the dressing. I used maybe 20% of the dressing. That was enough to give the salad some flavor but not oversaturate it. The apple really compliments this. I used extra lemon to taste.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;steph;5;PERFECTION! The flavor is to die for. I didn't have the peppers or onions but wow, the best I have ever had. I really like the apples - they added so much. And it's best to let it sit and chill for at least an hour before serving. Yummers!! My husband said it was the best he has ever had. This recipe is a KEEPER!! I
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;lovesfood;5;I cut back on sugar a little--still plenty sweet.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;hollyleach;5;I made this slaw for a Baby BBQ that I hosted for a close friend. It was the only dish that was empty after everyone finished eating. It was DELISH!! I have never been a cole-slaw fan, but this stuff is FINE... My husband and I have made it before and placed it on top of tiny pork loin sandwiches with sweet rolls. It's too easy not to try... I saved myself a lot of time by buying a 16 oz cole-slaw pack that was already mixed with carrots.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;32826;5;Very versatile. I used red cabbage and left out the bell pepper. I substituted two tablespoons of fat free miracle whip for the mayonnaise (barely enough to coat it), increased the lemon juice, and added salt and pepper (omitted the sugar). The apples gave it a great flavor and extra crunch.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;lindawlu;5;I basically used this recipe for the dressing because I like the broccoli slaw mixture that you can buy in the store. The dressing was very tasty. Sweet, creamy and tangy! Just perfect.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;marieandvern;5;EXCELLENT!!!!! Cole Slaw.....what more can be said. Great with Ribs.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;stephaniemartinez;4;Excellent recipe. However, I would recommend using less onion than indicated.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;orreym;5;This was a hit at our party. Everyone loved it!!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;audrey;5;"Very good but time consuming. I will defiantly make this again for a party but it takes too much time to make for just me and my husband. I used fat free plain yogurt instead of mayo. Follow the advice of other reviewers and sprinkle salt on the cabbage and let sit to help ""dry up"" some of the extra liquid. Additionally, put lemon on the apples while cutting them to keep from turning brown. Still use the original amount of lemon for the dressing. UPDATE: I wouldn't spend the time with adding salt to the cabbage to soak some of the water up. Just serve with a slotted spoon. Two days later, still eating it. Everything is still crisp. Very good and still looks great."
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;andrealynne;5;Excellent flavor. A nice change of pace from ordinary cole slaw.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;magnusmom;4;I thought it was good. I don't know what it was but it was not a big hit at the party. I thought the flavor was great and the colors made it more appealing. I followed the recipe as is.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jaygroah;5;Excellent! Very different from any cole slaw I've ever made. It IS sweet but just extremely tasty. As many others did, I added apple cider vinegar.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;doreen;5;Very tasty and colorful.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;amesnjames;5;I thought this was great cole slaw. I love the apples in it. As a time saver, I just bought bags of cole slaw mix. The cabbage is already shredded that way and there are already shredded carrots in it too. I just threw out the dressing pack that comes with and followed the recipe. I didn't use onions only because I forgot to buy them. I didn't chop the apples till I was ready to add them to everything else. I had no problems with them turning brown even after a couple days in the frig.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;crikkitt;4;I enjoyed this, but my kids didn't care for it. I'll make it again.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;mamadof3;5;I just finished mixing this up to serve with pulled pork sands for Halloween dinner. It is really delicious! I made it exactly as instructed with two exceptions - By accident I used white sugar while mixing my dressing. I did not want to throw it out so I just added a tablespoon of molasses and walla - brown sugar! Also, I did add a tablespoon of cider vinegar to cut the sweetness a bit. I will definitely make this again. It's really a pretty coleslaw, too!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;maryellenwessels;4;I made this with no red peppers but otherwise more or less as is. I think I used more apple though and a tish more lemon. Yum! I think craisins might be good in it too but haven't played with it. Thanks for the nice and versatile recipe!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;sbrantman;5;excellent recipe. I always come home with an empty bowl when I bring it to share! I did add a little apple cider vinegar to cut some of the sweetness, and used golden delicious apples. Yum!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;amyspring;5;Seriously one of my fav recipes! SO easy and so good. We used it as a topping and side for Turkey sloppy joes!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;vyilmaz88;5;"WOW..best fruit cole slaw EVER. Definitely try different apples, but gotta keep in the green apple for tart. When cutting the apples..toss with a tablespoon of lemon juice per apple to keep from browning and also add the amount of lemon juice the recipe calls for:) I kept all the reviewers suggestions in mind and my best suggestion would be too add everything in, but leave out the onions and bell pepper, then mix in the dressing (which is PERFECT as is) and taste...see if you like it sweeter rather than a bit more spicy? Spicy really isn't the word, but you know what I mean a bit closer to a neutral taste/tangy/tart side. I found adding the bell pepper after that was tangy enough so I omitted the onions. I also added a Tablespoon of Apple Vinegar..the mixture of tang to sweet was perfect, but make sure to cut the bell pepper into small pieces:) Oh and buy the precut cabbage bag mixed with carrots, cuts down the water build up;)"
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;rhayne99;5;I made this recipe for our company 4th of July picnic and it was a huge hit. i did change the recipe though, I added crushed pineapple, as many different apples as i could find and shredded carrots. in fact I probably took three different recipes and added them all together. That is the great thing about coleslaw, its so varying. i didn't add any sugar, figured the apples and the pineapple covered that... but I made a huge turkey pan full and it was completely gone by the end of hte picnic...
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;lovinlife26;5;It was very tasty! I did make one major change and that was using broccoli slaw mix (veggie only no sauce). I continue with adding everything else. I also made a few other minor changes adding lemon juice to apple after chopping. Lastly I added a splash of balsamic vingar. Delish!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;henryjoannevanthoff;5;This I think is my new and forever favorite. I did not have any green onion so I used 1/4 cup of white. I also just grabbed 2 apples from the tree outside. I as well did what another rater did, I tossed the lemon juice over the apples first to prevent them from browning.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;janenekingsleycook;5;The secret to this slaw is fine shredded cabbage. Worth purchasing the $20 shredded from Walmart just for this! Also, I only used fuji apples instead of the combo. Very good. I made this for 250 people and served it with BBQed pulled pork sandwiches. It was a hit and people that said they did not like Cole slaw loved it. Thank you for sharing!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;mikey;4;doesn't really taste like slaw at all more like a salad but very good i used half green cabage and half purple cabage loked very festive great side for a BBQ
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;2cutiesmom;5;Excellent!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;corrinne;4;Excellent! Definitely take the advice of adding some apple cider vinegar!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jane;5;Absolutely loved this. I omitted the pepper but it was otherwise a great dressing. Not vinegary. Very nice!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jilliankuhlmann;4;We enjoyed the dressing. However I wish I had left the onions out.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;novicelowfatchef;5;Awesome Recipe! Followed it exactly except used fat free mayo and less brown sugar - Still amazingly good and super easy!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;basilstone;5;This is a favorite at my house. It's nice because I normally have all the ingredients, and for some reason this really seems to fit the bill for cravings that I have for something like this sometimes. Like others have said, I coat the apples with the lemon juice to stop them from browning. This is such a quick and easy recipe!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;paula;5;This is fabulous! I did make a few changes: bagged coleslaw mix, Hellman's Light Mayonnaise, and Splenda Brown Sugar. Makes a wonderful side dish.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kellymacdonald;5;Really good! I left out the onion and bell pepper for personal preference plus I wanted the cole slaw to come out pretty sweet. We loved it. I will be making this again!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;cookieg;1;"This recipe was not very good. Other reviewers thought it was great, so I wonder what I did wrong. The bell pepper and onion flavors did not seem to blend well with the sweet dressing and apple flavors. The dressing pulled a lot of water out of the cabbage, leaving the slaw in two parts: watery liquid and solid. I was disappointed and a little uneasy about taking it to the neighbor's house for supper. I was thanked, but the only comment made was, ""It's refreshing."" No one uttered any other descriptive word. No one asked for the recipe. No one wanted the leftovers, either (I usually don't have leftovers at our neighborhood gatherings). Overall, this recipe was a disappointment."
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;happyclam;5;Added walnuts--delicious with or without! Very flexible recipe. A perfect cole slaw for the sweet tooth. Sweet but healthy! Great for a potluck.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;mncook;4;This was delicious! The apples make for an especially refreshing slaw! The sugar was a bit much for me, so would likely decrease to 1/4 cup next time. All in all, VERY good....got rave reviews....and I'll definitely make this again! I had an Aunt Mamie, too :)
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;korilavertue;4;This coleslaw was different and quite refreshing. I followed it exactly and wouldn't change a thing. I love the texture of the crisp apple and the sweetness that the red pepper adds. I will definitely be making this one again. Thanks for the delicious recipe!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;debsni;5;"Love it! Easy with a ""cheater"" bag of pre-cut cabbage mix."
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;taraanne;4;I'm not a pepper fan..... but based on other's reviews I added it anyway and was sorry. This would have been outstanding sans the red pepper. As it is, however, i'm only giving it 4 stars.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;litegal1;4;"Yikes - sweet (!); just made and am hoping sweetness from brown sugar will dissipate a bit once the other flavors have a chance to marry ... I'm surprised the tartness of the GS apple isn't coming through more. Will re-review once it's been fridged for a while. UPDATE: As written, giving this a 4 - had to tone down with more cabbage and some white wine vinegar, but (as hoped), the flavors really did mellow out nicely. Threw in a little pineapple and ended up quite pleased. TY so much for recipe."
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;debnewell;4;Very good. I made this exactly as written, very good but needs a tad more tart to my taste next time will add apple cider vinegar and celery for more savory.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;chattyg;5;So good!! I added chopped pecan since I left out the onions and peppers. Plus salt and heavy on the black pepper!!!!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;chad;5;We just finished making this for a Mothers Day cook out. I don't write many reviews, but wow is this ever good!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;descolada;5;I mixed the chopped apple with lemon juice prior to adding it to the salad. I also skip chopping up the cabbage and carrot and just pour in a 12oz bag of broccoli cole slaw since we make this so often. The flavors and textures are very nice in this dish and it compliments a wide variety of meals. Best the second day.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;caseybebop;4;Very good, tasty. Went well with rice and bean burgers.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;ritachick;4;This was very good - better the next day. I used a vidalia onion instead of green onion as that is what I had. I also lowered the brown sugar to maybe 1/4 cup and used lot's of Cider Vinegar for a nice twang!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;krissy0187;5;Absolutely the best coleslaw I've had. The kids even like it because of the apples and everyone repeatedly asks me to make this. Thanks!!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jjketark;4;Pretty darn good, but not so wonderful that I'll make it too often. I never was much of a slaw person, but I did enjoy the apple slaw.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;sizial;5;Nice flavor - first I thought it was a bit too sweet, but the next day the flavors melded and it wasn't at all. Good twist on traditional slaw.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;banshezmom;4;I really liked this cole slaw. I made a couple of changes based on what I had and another review. I subbed celery for the pepper and used a gala apple and a red delicious because that is what I had. I omitted the green onion because I didn't have any, but next time I make this it will be included to give the salad that extra little zip. Thanks for sharing this delcious alternative to the mayo-laden cole slaws.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;arlenemurphy;5;I made this for Easter Dinner today and just tasted it after standing overnight. I did add some extra Savoy cabbage to it and added a little more mayo. Let me tell you, I am not a cole slaw lover, but this is just wonderful. I can't wait for my guests to try it. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jem;5;I used light mayo, a little honey and replaced half the brown sugar with splenda.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;missdrea;4;this was easy and yummy. i used celery instead of bell pepper (didnt have any) and really liked the apple/celery combo so i would recommend adding it in. i also used white vinegar instead of lemon juice and it worked fine. after i combined the cut up veggies and fruit i placed the mixture in a strainer to drain the excess water and sprinkled it with some vinegar to prevent the apples from browning. even though i drained some of the excess liquid i should have started it earlier because it was a bit runny for my taste. this was very good with french fries, baked beans, and bbq pulled pork sandwiches.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;marcythorner;5;I first found this recipe about a year ago and have made it since several times. It's a huge favorite with a couple of small tweaks: (1) add a couple tablespoons of lightly salted sunflower seeds (the salt-sweet combo is heavenly), and (2) increase mayo to 1/2 c. and add 1/4 c. apple cider or balsamic vinegar. I've made it this way and brought it to several gatherings, and it's always one of the first dishes to disappear. I'll be making it even more now that I've acquired a good food processor. Aunt Mamie, you're my hero!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;ginaizzyshores;5;Delicious!!! You can add pineapple and nuts to this too. I toasted ramen noodles and pine nuts tossed with sesame oil and seasoned salt in the oven then mixed in and the salty with the sweet was to die for.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;ladysparkle;5;Delicious! I used green and red cabbage. 1 red apple and two red pears. Loved it!!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;michellejo3;5;This is wonderful and I'm not even a big cole slaw fan! Will definitely make again! Only thing I changed was I used Truvia instead of brown sugar. I can't believe I made homemade coleslaw and it was great!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jeanetterauchle;5;This is, by far, the best coleslaw I have ever had.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;bakingnana;5;I have made this recipe twice for a family that I cook for. They love it! The first time I made it exactly as written. The next time I added raisins, dried cherries & chopped pecans. Delicious. Thanks for a good recipe.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;erz2002;5;I don't like traditional coleslaw but this is very good! I made this as directed except for two small changes: (1) left out the onions (don't care for them) and (2) squeezed a tablespoon of lemon juice over the apples to prevent them from browning. I'm sure the leftovers will be even better.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;claresmommy;5;Yummo. Thought this was delicious. Followed the recipe exactly. A nice change from our usual coleslaw withth apple mix. Would definitely make again.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;gmorgan;5;This apple slaw is simply delicious. I added a handful of walnuts which gave it a great crunch. I also left out the red bell pepper and thought this was wonderful.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;heatherhope;5;Great cole slaw recipe! I think I'll add some pecans next time!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;quiltersammy;5;WOOHOO! This is yummy! My only changes were 1/3 cup rice vinegar (and no lemon juice), a handful of craisins and some celery salt.....a real winner at our table.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;mk;4;Very good! I omited the onions because I forgot them, but I don't think it was missing anything without them. I did all of the shredding in my food proccessor to speed it along. Make sure you let it sit in the dressing for a while before serving. I might cut down on the amount of cabbage next time (just to 2-2.5 c) but that is a personal taste preference. Thanks for this different coleslaw!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;konwal;5;This was very good. I used bagged cole slaw mix. Also put the chopped apples in a bowl with lemon juice as I was chopping them. I was afraid that there was not enough dressing and added another half a batch. After sitting, this turns out to have been a mistake. Next time I will make just as written.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;sharonshall;1;So I guess I am going to be the bad guy here amongst all these raving reviews. First, I am a pretty darn good cook and second, I followed the recipe to the letter. I made this for a dinner held for a family after a funeral and I was a little embarrassed that everyone knew it was mine. Onion should not be in this recipe, just too much for the apples and the brown sugar. I was terribly dissapointed. If I did something wrong I don't know what since I did not stray from what is written here. Sorry, I won't be making this again.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;mommyluvs2cook;5;Loved this slaw!!! I couldn't stop eating it! I can't wait for a family get together so I can impress with this!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;mrsd;5;This was quite a hit at a football tailgate. Nice alternative to traditional cole slaw. Used bagged shredded cabbage and it came together quickly. Will make this again!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;corpman;5;Nobody in my household likes slaw except for my husband, but something about the sweet/tart combo here makes the kids forget that they're eating cabbage. Definitely my go-to slaw.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;tulipsntruffles;5;Off the charts good! I fed 200 people this slaw recently and everyone was floored at how amazing it is - and it's really so very easy! The dressing makes it! I will say, though, that I will only dress this slaw the same day I'm serving it. I didn't care for it the day after. A+ recipe!!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;renee5774;5;As other reviewers have done I omitted the onion and pepper. It is a fantastic cole slaw. I think next time I make it I will add walnuts for a little variety. My whole family says it is definitely a keeper.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;huskergirl;4;This was yummy! I did leave out the carrot because my husband won't eat them. I loved the combo of apples and red pepper and the dressing was great. I didn't care for the leftovers, though, so I would recommend making for a big group or reducing the recipe. Thanks for sharing!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;rachelm;4;I also added 1 tsp. white vinegar to the dressing and it was good. This cole slaw is more like a cabbage SALAD.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;wayneandjen;5;I hate cole slaw, but kids and husband love it. So on a whim (and a cabbage I received from my CSA), I made this and LOVED IT.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;laidback;5;"I gotta say, I am not a big cole slaw fan. BUT! This is really good! I did change a few things. On the apples I grated half and chopped half of each apple. Thought it would be too chunky. And I did not have any lemons in, so used a splash of apple cider vinegar. This was really good! I also used the last fresh cabbage out of garden, which does not hurt! ;)"
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;harewizard;4;This was good. Tasted fresh and was easy to make. Great with grilled apple sausage!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kareningalsbe;5;Wow! This is great cole slaw! The changes I made were minor. I used a bag of shredded cabbage/cole slaw, the juice of 1/2 a lemon and Splenda Brown Sugar Blend in place of regular brown sugar. Served it to company and they loved it too. Even better after sitting for a day or two. Thanks for this recipe. Will make it again and again!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;traci;4;Not bad, we weren't crazy about the dressing, I think I would like it better with vinegar instead of brown sugar.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;donnaralphalbury;4;very delicious! I added sliced almonds and also squeezed lemon juice over the apples so they would not turn dark.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;maryumemoto;5;Absolutely delicous!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;vegascook08;5;This slaw was sweet and tart. Easy to make.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;lizziecooper;5;This was delicious! Omitted the pepper and lemon juice and it was still great! It was even better the next day when all the flavors milled together. Thank you, Aunt Mamie. (I actually have an Aunt Mamie)
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;elenaalba;5;I've made this several times and it is delicious! It doesn't keep, even over night, but that's usually not a problem because it gets gobbled up. I've also substituted fat free mayo and reduced the amount of sugar but it is best with the original recipe.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;a96byrd;5;This is a keeper! I use what ever kind of apple I have on hand.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jenn;5;I made this exactly as written (though I used pre-chopped cabbage/carrot mix), and it was delicious!! This will definitely be thrown into regular rotation.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;damon;4;As-is, this recipe leaves the cole slaw quite dry. I like it that way. If you like your slaw soggy, you should double the mayo and lemon juice!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;lindal;4;This has a really nice flavor. It's a nice change from regular coleslaw.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;nicoleberger;4;It was a nice change to the traditional coleslaw. I think it is best eaten fresh because the apples get a little mushy the next day.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;prancalot;4;The 'BEST' Cole Slaw I have eaten in a very long time. I have tasted and eaten many a cabbage cole slaws, but this one is the tops!!!!!! Prancalot
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;susiekew;5;This was delicious and very easy to make with coleslaw mix instead of chopping cabbage and shredding carrots. Left out the red pepper as I had red pepper in another part of the meal. Halved the sugar and added about a tbsp of buttermilk to stretch the dressing further. It was beautiful to look at and delicious to eat. Who could ask for anything more? Thanks!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;lewalcindortx;5;yummy!!!!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;holly;5;This is my new cole slaw recipe! It's pretty, refreshing, and not all mayonnaise-y like some of the others out there. I do recommend following the advice of the most popular review on here to reduce the liquid though. I didn't this time and had to use a slotted spoon for serving, but it was still fine.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;haven;4;This is very good and easy to put together. The only change it really needs is added cider vinegar. Without it there's really not much flavor. Delicious.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;debimichelajacques;5;"The best Cole Slaw ever!! I did add a few raisens and used low fat mayo. My husband said ""be sure and keep this receipe!!!!!"" Thank you so much!! I will make again."
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;h3lash;5;Love this recipe!!! I always get compliments on it and even my mother-in-law said that she liked it!!!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;sukiesue;5;I made this for a party. I doubled it and I also used packaged cabbage. I also used Walla Walla sweet onions. I made the night before and it was wonderful. None left!! Mine was not watery at all. Some liquid but it was thicker than water. So yummy, will make again. Great salad!!!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;connie;5;This was a hit at my parents on Fathers Day. Very refreshing and light dressing. Normally I leave out the onion and pepper but this time I didn't and the flavors blended so well that those two ingredients did not stand out so prominent. Make sure you salt the cabbage and let it drain because there will be plenty of liquid after you mix it.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;cerinedemure;4;This is a great recipe. I doubled it, using a whole head of cabbage, 4 apples, 2 julienned carrots and the red bell pepper diced. I forgot to buy the onion. Almost doubled the dressing. After letting it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours.....OMG! My boyfriend, who is not a regular salad eater, will eat this for days and days. Next time, I will try the lower calorie variations, i.e. yogurt for mayo, less sugar, etc. But this is a timeless summer recipe.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;ellen;5;I made this for a big party and had many people ask me for the recipe. I used other suggestions of buying the bag of prechopped cabbage & carrots, and adding almonds & dried cranberries. Great summer salad!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;crystals;5;This is an absolutely awesome recipe. So simple and easy to throw together. For a change of pace, I occasionally throw in pecans or sunflower seeds for a little something different... This has joined a list of favorites in our household!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;nyangel1203;4;"What a great refreshing slaw recipe. Instead of chopping my apples and carrot, I julienned them. Like other reviewers, I reduced the amount of sugar. I also added some raisins. I waited to dress the slaw just before serving to reduce that ""watery"" consistency it sometimes gets. I served this along side Apple/Maple Turkey burgers and Sweet Potato Fries. What a wonderful meal. I will definately make this again."
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;rodanee;5;I made this to bring to Mom's for Mother's day and it was very well received. I did cut the sugar to 1/4 cup, used only 1 green onion and added 1TBS. of apple cider vinegar.I also added a sprinkle of poppy seeds and 1/4 c. of dried cranberries. This will be a regular staple in my menu planning. Thank you.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;busybee25;5;I gave this recipe to my sister-in-law as a suggestion for an apple-themed dinner party we were having. She made it, but boy did I eat it. So tasty. She said she took other reviewers suggestion to cut the sweetness with a little more vinegar. Very good and crisp. And pretty -- with the red apples and red pepper and a carrot in the slaw mix.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;emmylotus;4;"Add some dill & poppy seeds; also explore adding some buttermilk. My guests raved. My only critique is that it was a little too much on the sweet side...it probably only needs 1/4 c. of sugar or less instead of 1/3c., but with some vinegar or buttermilk, it balanced out nicely and it was delish!"
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;staceybrownlund;4;I made this for an women's potluck and it passed with 5 stars! Adult taste buds loved it! My kids and kid-like husband could taste the green onion and didn't care for it. I will definitely make it again for the family, but 1/2 the green onion.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;amy;5;"I've gotten so many compliments on this recipe and am always requested to bring it! What I like to do is, thinly slice the apples with a mandolin before chopping them (I also slice the red pepper this way, and squeeze out all of the juice before addding to everything); I think it helps the flavors to blend more when dealing with smaller pieces as opposed to large chunks. I also use Splenda brown sugar to cut the carbs a bit and you can't even tell the difference (on the bag, it will tell you the amount to use). One last thing, I buy the pre-packaged angel hair cabbage, and like that best. Thanks for the great recipe!!!"
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;ninat;5;Very yummy and so easy!!! My family loved it!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;gorny;5;"This is the BEST! The quanities of the ingredients are perfect. Onion will overpower and Red Pepper can overpower. Be careful. I am asked for the recipe EVERYTIME..Let the ""dressing sit abit"" to allow the br sugar to dissolve before adding it to the salad. You won't be disappointed. Soooooo Good!"
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;foxeytexan;5;Made this recipe for a pot luck and it was all eaten---to good to be real.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;tofu19;3;This was ok with some modifications. I used only 1/4 cup sugar and it was still little too sweet for us. Sorry, wanted to like it.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;ann;5;YUM! Thanks to another reviewer, I added FF plain yogurt to the dressing and less mayo. I also used less brown sugar and more lemon, cider vinegar so it wasn't quite as sweet. I added cilantro to the salad. I pretty much doubled the dressing which worked out well because we liked it so much that I added more cabbage and apple to it and we had it the next day! A keeper!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;chris;5;this is a great refreshing recipe. I served it to friends and they immediately asked for the recipe! the apples add that special something to coleslaw that I normally find bland and tasteless.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;rosemarystanley;5;This is a prime recipe!! I made a 30 serving recipe at a church retreat and it got rave reviews. I had made it for my family earlier and they loved it also! The only change I made was toreduce the amount of brown sugar. Just a little too sweet with the amount listed. i started with half and added to taste. didn't take too much more. I will make it again!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jimw;5;We served this as a cool accompaniment to spicy Cajun food and it was perfect. Thanks Aunt Mamie!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;chacha7602;5;I made this recipe tonight and my family LOVED it! I forgot to buy the red pepper but will definitely add next time. It was so easy to make and the result was just wonderful - not too sweet and tangy enough. I will DEFINITELY make this again! Thanks, Aunt Mamie!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;janetr;4;"Made this with a bag of ""broccoli slaw"". Hubby and I both liked it. I also slightly increased the brown sugar and slightly decreased the mayo according to our tastes. I will definitely make this again."
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;serenelooney;5;what a GREAT recipe for a fall/winter side dish. yum!!!!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;sophia;4;I used more lemon juice to give it a sweet and sour taste. We all love it! Thanks!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;nicolerenaecoselmon;5;This was delicious! My children even ate it which is shocking to me!! It was very tasty!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;k;5;This slaw was soooo good! I also left out the bell pepper since I didn't have any on hand. I didn't miss it at all. The texture and crunch were perfect. I did add a TBS of cider vinegar to counter the sweet of the brown sugar. Other then that I followed the recipe and was amazed at the results!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;lorikcogan;5;This was really yummy! I used two honeycrisp apples, as that is what I had on hand. I also did as another poster suggested and tossed the chopped apples in the lemon juice to keep them from browning. I will try adding a dash of cider vinegar next time to give a little tartness.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;lynnsmall;5;add tbsp of apple cider vinegar, roasted pecans or walnuts and dried cranberries
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;karineumann;5;I made this to go with pulled pork sandwiches and my guests RAVED about the slaw. I couldn't find red bell peppers at the store - omitted them. Didn't miss them, either! With a mandolin, the slicing and shredding was a snap. It looked a little dry after I mixed it, so I tossed in a little extra mayonnaise. I snacked on it all day before the party, it was SO GOOD. I will use this as my standard potluck recipe for the year. I like to have a guaranteed success recipe - good for a crowd and not too expensive. This fits the bill. Thanks, allrecipes!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jessicaa;4;As far as coleslaw goes, this is very good...probably the best coleslaw that I've ever had. I nearly doubled the recipe, but only needed the same amount of mayo/brown sugar, and it was still very juicy. My husband loved it too, and I don't think he normally likes cole slaw that much.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kate;5;Our new favorite slaw! I added a splash of red wine vinegar because I like the tang.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;bubbasmom;3;I added cranberries and toasted walnuts as suggested by others, but I tasted it before doing so. Pretty bland before (though I liked the dressing) and better with the additions. Decent and different, but I probably won't make again.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;mishi;5;This was delicious! I am not normally a huge fan of cole slaw, but this was so incredibly tasty! My husband loved it too! I think next time I might try it with a little vinegar (although I personally like the sweetness as it is) or with a little less dressing. I love that it doesn't use a ton of mayo like many cole slaws.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;amy;5;Loved it with my BBQ Pork for Sandwiches found on this site. Hubby doesn't do onions and I didn't have the bell pepper. Still yummy! Will try slivered almonds when I have them next time.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;sue;5;I made as the recipe but substituted half the mayo with low fat natural yoghurt, to cut the fat. Don't think it altered it much. It is a great coleslaw, thanks for the recipe!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;melissaperrelli;4;I liked this but the people at the party weren't cole slaw eaters. Don't know what to make next time for a veggie with pulled pork that isn't potato.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;tlthompson;4;Quite good. The ratio of apples to slaw was a little high, will add more slaw next time. Added toasted walnuts, craisins and raisins. Used the lemon juice to toss the apples (julienne) added cider vinegar to the dressing. Had to add more cider and mayo to make enough (we prefer our slaw moist). Big hit with the kids, hubby frowned until he had a taste.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;norm;4;Not bad at all. A good way to use apples that might be sitting around. I will make again. I used the pre-shredded cabbage in the bag, which made it even easier.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jk;5;Wow, I've never had a Cole Slaw this good. I followed the recipe exactly, except I was short two apples. Still fantastic. I will make this one often for picnics.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;lillian;5;This was very good! I tweaked it to fit my tastes. I omitted the onions and peppers. I added 1/4 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup chopped walnuts. I also used red cabbage. I highly recommend using the cheddar because its a nice contrast between the apples and the sweet dressing. This is a very unique and tasty cole slaw!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;marthacochell;4;This was a tad sweet for me, so I would probably use less sugar next time. I also like the idea of adding apple cider vinegar, although I didn't think of that because I didn't read the reviews first. I used red cabbage, one huge braeburn apple, and left out the green onions, as I didn't have any. The salad is really pretty, although the dressing turned a little pink due to the red cabbage. I would definitely make this again with a little tweaking.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jenbishop;4;I had to add a tbsp of apple cider vinegar to this to make it taste the way I like it. Wasn't the same without the vinegar.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;darindacooks;5;This is really great! I didn't have red bell peppers on hand so I used green, and instead of green onion I used sweet onion.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;ellen;5;Excellent! I used a little less mayo and 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar. Took the suggestion and also added dried cranberries and sliced almonds. A very healthy side dish!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jillie64;4;I loved it! The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I made changes based on other reviews. I added 2 Tbsp of Cider vinegar to the dressing. I tossed granny smith and zestar apple chunks in lemon juice to keep from browning. I used a bag of classic cole slaw mix(has shredded carrots in it already), tossed in slivered almonds and some mixed blend raisins(cran, golden, cherry & blue) from Trader Joe's. Also, I think next time I'd use a little less brown sugar. I give my version 5 stars! Hope this is useful information!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;tigerj44;5;Great! So good!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;chelleoxford;4;Very tasty recipe for a fresh kind of cole slaw. I used 2 fuji apples and it tasted yummy!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;somethingdifferentagain;5;"Loved the creamy, sweet brown sugar dressing with the fresh veggies and crunch of the apples. Added a very nice & new touch for a picnic of grilled burgers and potato salad. This is a ""keeper""."
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;lemka;4;A tasty different take on coleslaw. Try this one on kids that don't like traditional slaw, it's mild and sweet.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;debbiewillman;5;Q!uick. Easy. Delicious. I left out the red pepper since I simply don't care for it. I used light mayo and Splenda Brown sugar instead of the regular stuff. My guests really enjoyed it, and I've since forwarded the recipe on. Next time, I'm thinking I'll add some walnuts.....
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;sunny;5;Good!!! We didn't use the red pepper. And we added 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and some chopped walnuts as others had suggested. We also did not use a regular red delicious apple, but that's a minor adjustment.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kellyp;5;This is like a cross between cole slaw and waldorf salad. I left out the onion and bell pepper (didn't have any on hand)and substituted lime juice instead of lemon. Really delicious. I also added some pecans and poppy seeds. Thanks for the recipe.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;dianas;5;My family loves cole slaw and I enjoy trying the many different varieties of this classic salad. This is a great sweet slaw. I love the original recipe but I have also made this one adding sliced grapes and chopped walnuts. I usually leave out the green pepper for this variation. It ends up like a Waldorf salad/cole slaw... really good!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;mdriddle;5;This recipe is excellent! I followed the recipe exactly, except I bought pre-shredded carrots. This Apple Cole Slaw will be a regular in our household.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;susie;4;Very yummy! The second time I made this I did the apple last so it wouldn't turn dark before adding the dressing. I used my food processor to make even easier.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kann3140;5;Very good!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;victoriabinggeli;3;this one was just okay. it tasted as though something was missing. maybe walnuts or pecans would have given it a punch.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;beckyd;5;I had to adjust this recipe because I did not have all the ingredients in the house. Basically I used the cabbage, apples, onions, miracle whip and brown sugar (reduced amount due to sweetness of miracle whip). It was fantastic! This is the only coleslaw recipe I will use in the future. Can't wait to see how it turns out when I use all the ingredients. Thank you for the recipe!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;pamfromli;3;Very good, I think next time I will try and lessen the sugar amount. There was a tip from another person to drain the cabbage 1st, I think I will try that next time as well. Good salad for a work night or putting a bbq together quickly. Nice taste
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;anastasia;4;This is an interesting twist on cole slaw. It has a little extra crunch from the apples. We liked the sweetness of the brown sugar. Give this one a try for something a little drifferent.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;esquared;3;"I liked the dressing on this quite a bit. The balance between the sweet of the sugar (used only about 1/2 of what was called for...) and the ""tang"" of the lemon is very nice. Good starting point for whatever you wanted to include in the slaw. Simply because I didn't feel like doing all the shredding/chopping I used only one apple (gala, I think...) and skipped the carrot all together. May well include it next time though. May also add a handful of raisins/""craisins"" and/or some toasted pecans. I'll probably play around with this a bit. Thanks for the recipe."
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;ade;5;Amazing! The peppers and the apples together create such a delicious flavor! I will definitely make this again and again!!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;chatty304;5;Made this for a Memorial Day BBQ to go along side w/ ribs ---an excellent switch up to the usual slaw! I used equal amounts of green and sweet vidalia onion. I also sprinkled apples w/ a little lemon juice to prevent browning and added about 1/2-3/4 cup of sunflower seeds. I used 1 1/2 times amount for the mayo mixture. Not dry or too much liquid. I loved the crunchiness from the apples and onion and sunflower seeds. One of the best slaws I've ever had! Everyone loved it!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kcdia;5;yummy!no peppers for me but the apples and mayo mix were perfect with for pulled bbq pork!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kauai17;5;This was delish!!!! Made it for our Mother's Day BBQ and it was a hit. Great combo of flavors. The apple gives it a sweet flavor while the bell pepper gives it a kick. Definitely a keeper!!!!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jms;5;This was the BEST! I have never made cole slaw before so I picked a few of the recipes and made scaled down versions of them for a fish fry we had and by far this was my and everyone elses favorite. This was the only one that was completely gone before the night was through. I even had a chef who attended the fry ask for the recipe so she could make it for her family. It was GREAT!!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kami;5;This is delicious!!! A great side to any barbeque.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;mary;5;The dressing is a good shortcut alternative to my other dressing of oil, sugar , vinegar which is boiled and cooled before using.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;ahoffort;5;simple, very good as far as coleslaw goes.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jumpercable;5;This is a great dish, I've made it several times and once for a company meal. Everybody that has tried it loves it.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;dddmamsi;4;This was a very good Slaw recipe. It was a nice change from the usual. I think next time I will cut the onions in half. It was a little too oniony.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;mitzi;5;Fabulous!!!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;golfbhard;5;Loved it! The dressing was very tasty. We used a salad shooter and the texture was more ground up than the picture looked, but still wonderful. I think I'll keep using the shooter to grate the veggies. I omitted the red bell pepper, do not really care for it in slaw. Delish!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;themakerofdinner;5;This is a new family favorite. I follow the recipe step for step. I add a little lemon jucie to the apples after I dice them to avoid browing. Everyone loves this dish when I take it to any get together.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;ernestineburton;5;ONE OF THE BEST COLESLAW RECIPES I HAVE EVER TRIED, MY WHOLE FAMILY HAS ASKED ME FOR THE RECIPE, AND I HAVE SENT IT TO THEM, THEY ALL LIKE IT.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jennifermorgan;5;Great Cole Slaw - If you like it sweet and we do. Actually, I used a crispin apple instead of the Granny Smith, so that may have added to the sweetness. I also used miracle whip instead of mayo (my husband's preference). The brown sugar did NOT make it look brown, I feared this but, it was all good -actually has an overall nice colorful appearance. The only other change I made, is I added a can of crushed pineapple. It just didn't seem like coleslaw without pineapple. VERY GOOD recipe!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;saraann6;5;I made this for a football tailgate with 25 people and it was a huge hit. I made it the night before and then the next morning drained off the excess liquid and it tasted great. It was very easy to make and I highly recommend it!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;brig;5;My kids loved it! I was pleasantly surprised! I did use red cabbage (very pretty on the plate) and left out the onions and pepper.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;erinbarnhart;4;The flavor is delicious, but the brown sugar gave a brownish color to the salad. That color change put off my husband and son who are my cole slaw eaters. They said they felt like they were eating old cabbage. Such a shame because the flavor is wonderful.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kstubble;5;I used the broccoli/cabbage pre-made mix. I also used low fat mayo. It was very yummy.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;goodcook;5;Tried this recipe just as asked. Was a hit. Fine the next day for lunch. Will use low-fat mayo next time..did add 2 tbsp lemon juice.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;futurechefshay;4;I was pretty happy with this recipe, I'm always on a neverending hunt for the perfect coleslaw!! I salted my cabbage like a previous member suggested and it worked to keep my cabbage crispy, even till the next day!! The only thing I changed was that I used Miracle Whip instead of Mayo so I also cut down on the lemon juice. Even my super picky sister was going back for seconds!!!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kelly58;4;I thought this was really good. I did add two tablespoons of lemon juice and left out the bell pepper and green onions (nobody really likes them). The apples gave a nice twist to this dish. Thanks!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;amyandbren;2;I didn't like but my husband thought it was okay. Although I won't be making it again, my advice is to eliminate the green onions for those who do make this.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kimscottlakin;5;This recipe was great. I made this for a casual dinner party and everyone raved! Will definitely make again.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;callmedonnareed;5;"This is _the_ best slaw I've ever had. It's nicely balanced in that sweet/tangy way, with the finish of a creamy mouth feel without being overly mayonnaise-y. The sweet crunch of the apples is a nice bonus alongside the crunchy cabbage. I did make a couple of changes, from necessity: I used the juice of one lime and about 4 T rice vinegar, because I'm out of lemons. (I suspect apple cider vinegar would have made a fine substitute, if I'd had any.) I used about 1/4 c. finely minced Vidalia onions instead of the green onions. And, I left out the pepper because I'm out of that, too; but I will be trying it next time. I also tossed the apples in the lime juice before mixing them in, as another reviewer suggested. This is going to be my standard recipe from now on."
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;katherine;5;As far as coleslaw goes, this was good and pretty healthy too. I used low fat mayo and it tasted great! This was a crowd pleaser overall and I would make again to take to an outdoor party!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;karen325;4;Nice twist on coleslaw. The apple and honey gave this dish and nice sweet flavor without overpowering this dish.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;colle1979;4;Didn't change the recipe at all and it was great. The sweetness of the dressing and the addition of the apples was a great change from the usual.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;carlabrown;5;We really enjoyed this change of pace recipe. I will be using this many more times during this summer for picnics. I didn't change a thing except adding a handful of raisins and toasted almonds.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;bb34;3;Ok. Nobody raved, but they did eat it.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;fran;5;This one is even better the day after. I added a bit more dressing. Will make this one again!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;barbmillis;3;This was ok but noone liked it as well as my oriental cole slaw recipe. The dressing was still sweet and I only used 3/4 cups sugar. It tasted like apples with a light dressing. I'll not make this again.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;lmm;5;Wonderful recipe! I followed the recipe exactly, except I left out the bell pepper (I don't like bell pepper), & I used light mayo. It turned out absolutely delicious! I was a little bit skeptical about leaving the peel on the apples, but after the apples were chopped up in the slaw, the peels just added a little extra crunch and color. I used a food processor to chop all the vegetables and apples, which made the pieces very finely chopped, but I think this recipe would be equally good with larger, chunkier pieces. This is a recipe that I will definitely make again!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;muddymom;5;Just a note to my original review to say that I replaced the brown sugar in this recipe with coconut palm sugar, a more healthy choice, and one that requires much less in quantitiy for the same sweetness. Still a great, popular recipe around this house! A delicious blend of flavors and texture combine to make a nice addition to a summer barbecue. I added a bit more mayo and lemon juice when the slaw was too dry with original ingredients. I also added two tablespoons of sour cream. Vidalia or red onion will also work fine, as well as celery instead of red pepper. After several events, everyone who has tried this slaw gives compliments. Thank you.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;tammy;5;This is a great side dish with BBQ. I made pulled pork sandwiches and served this on the side. Didn't have any left. All the ladies left with the recipe in hand. So easy......
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;tea;5;mmm SO GOOD! I really liked this. After I got done chopping everything up I tasted it and the flavor was amazing but I wanted it more grated so I ran it through the food process. Delicious!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;ginah1;5;We are not fans of bell peppers, so I left them out which did not make a difference to us. I served this with the Reuben Sandwich recipe from this site and it was really good. Great for a quick and easy meal.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;tammymcurry;5;I was skeptical of this because of the red pepper, but it was wonderful! I made if for my son's birthday party and everyone loved it. I have since incorporated a lot of the ingredients and modified to make my own cole slaw.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;eburgess;5;This is excellent! One of the best cole slaws I have ever made!!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;pl;4;easy to make- only had the cabbage, carrots and fuji apples-so used that. Added about 1.5 Tbsp of rice vinegar for alittle extra kick. Kid and spouse liked it. Would make it again.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;chikee;4;Very nice change of pace. I used pineapple in place of the apples as I was trying to replicate a favorite slaw that is store bought. I added some pineapple juice to the dressing mixture as well. Will make this one again, and plan to using the apples! Thank you!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;melissawa;5;Everyone just loved this!!!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;phyllisgrant;5;I have been looking for a recipe that tasted like the expensive coleslaw we buy from the turkey deli. Well, this one fits the bill! My husband just loved it and told me not to misplace this recipe.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;mason204;5;Excellent slaw. I used red cabbage and mine looked drastically different but the taste was great. It's a refreshing salad which cheered up a gray day in the middle of winter. This would be a good summertime salad. I was wary of the red pepper but it was fine in the salad. The apple really added to the taste. This would be great to bring to a pot luck.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;laura2379;3;This was only good after sitting in the fridge over night. But I'm not a big mayo fan so I think mayo and apples just dosent do it for me.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;julie;4;This coleslaw was very tasty. I didn't have a green apple so I just used red and it still turned out great!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;cassandra;5;This is really excellent, easy and tastes very fresh. I've made this several times now, and I find I like it better with a bit less brown sugar and a bit more lemon. I also tend to use only one apple, but it's also lovely with two.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;bcmiller;5;I used a bag of broccoli slaw and added the apples and the dressing. This was delicious. We had guests for dinner and we were scraping the bowl. So easy and flavorfull.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;louisecol;5;"Fantastic! I'm not a big slaw fan, but had purchased the ""cutest"" little head of cabbage and needed to use it. I chose this recipe simply because the ingredients matched my fridge findings. Oh yum! With the crisp, sweet apples in the cole slaw, I am a convert."
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;patty;5;This was an excellent side dish for our bbq ribs. I added some raisins and walnuts. Very delicious.

f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;peggy;5;A big hit at a Girlz Night Dinner Party!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;daisy;5;I stand in awe. My husband normally doesn't like vegetables. When it came time for seconds, my husband was heaping more cose slaw onto his plate, and left the main dish alone! What a wonderful surprise! I loved the mix of flavors and textures. I did use a double portion of the sauce, I don't know if that's just because I used bigger veggies, or if I just really liked the sauce, anyway, it was great. Thanks,
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;llmanager;5;Great! I just made this recipe. I was looking for a quick salad to go with dinner. I had all the ingredients on hand. Since I am a calorie watcher I used miracle whip free, and splenda brown sugar blend. Terrific.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;afgrandma;5;I made this for a family reunion today and everyone really liked it, will definately make this again and share the recipe with friends
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;mustangsusan;5;Great cole slaw recipe! Different from traditional cole slaw. At first I wasn't sure about the dressing, but it was delicious! No leftovers in our house. I will definitely make this again and maybe add some dried cranberries just to be different. Thank you!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;susan;4;This is a pretty good cole slaw recipe. I omitted the brown sugar from the recipe and thought that the flavor was just right without it.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kristininatlanta;5;I have some neighbors that we potluck with often. ALL this slaw was devoured, and we usually don't finish anyone's dish (I guess we all make too much). I didn't have cabbage so I used a bag of that broccoli slaw. I mistakenly put in a bit too much brown sugar, but everyone liked it so I will do it that way again.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;lindper;5;This is great ! Very colorful and full of fruit. Nice change from regular cole slaw. The only trouble with it is that I can't stop eating it !!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;chefkasey;3;"This was just ""okay"" and I usually really love sweet cole slaws. Unfortunately, this was just TOO sweet and contained WAY TOO MANY apples. I made this for a barbeque I had and it was the only thing that was leftover (and the men I know don't usually leave ANYTHING...). If you decide to make it, be aware that the red bell pepper and the abundance of apples really dominates the taste!!!"
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;tuxedoville;3;Nice for something different, but I wouldn't make it again. It's quite good right when it's made, but the dressing seems to take over by the time it gets to the table and it's really too tired to eat the next day.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;rowork;5;Super Yummy. Used just a little less brown sugar and a bit more lemon juice. I wouldn't imagine this would keep well, but who cares? Give me a big bowl and a fork and I'll eat the whole dang thing - it's that good.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;happymommyx4;5;Very Yummy! I used fresh lemon juice. I also used all the juice from one lemon. I will make this again!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;barnkitty;3;"Interesting flavor. Tastes of apple, cabbage and onion. Good if you want something ""different."" Only giving this a 3-star as we actually had enough leftovers to throw out and my hubby is a slaw-lover."
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;drofrub;5;Fantastic! I doubled this for a party and it was the first thing gone. Many people asked for the recipie. I subbed 1c of broccoli slaw for cabbage, added green and yellow peppers and more carrotts. Very pretty and delicious!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;basg101;5;Fabulous! I doubled for company and nothing was left!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;amygreger;5;Easy to make and delicious. Love it!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;lisalc98;5;Excellent!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kelcampbell;2;This wasn't a favourite at our Thanksgiving table this year. My family just found it way too sweet to be coleslaw. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the apples - I used 3 small Mac's instead of what the recipe called for. In the end, I tried to add a bit of mayo and some more lemon juice to take some of the sweetness out - but it was a lost cause. If you're into a more 'savory' coleslaw (ie, mayo based), I'm afraid this isn't the one for you.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;holliecardenas;5;Definately better the second day. I didn't use the green pepper because I don't like them, and it was still very tasty. Even my sister who is very picky about coleslaw, loved it!!! Thanks for the excellent recipe!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;redgrape40;5;This recipe was fantastic. It's probably the best slaw I've ever had. I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and added a couple Tbl. of cider vinegar in addition to the lemon juice. Thanks for the recipe Aunt Mamie.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;tamasa;5;This cole slaw is soooo good, I followed the recipe almost exactly, the only thing I did differently was to put a tablespoon of lemon juice on the apples while I chopped up the rest of the ingriedients, I did this the first time I made the salad, I didn't do it the second time and the apples turned brown after 2 days. I still added the lemon juice that the recipe calls for.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;missdvs;5;My friend brought this salad to work and it was a hit! I loved it. It is so refreshing! I made this for my boyfriend today who is a coleslaw fanatic and he loved it. I did buy a bag of pre-shredded cabbage/carrot mix to make prep easier and I added 1 tsp vinegar because he doesn't like things too sweet. I think the next time I make this for myself I will add some dried cranberries and sliced almonds as another reviewer suggested. Thanks for a great recipe!!!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;seasons3;4;This was too sweet for me, so I added an extra tbs of vinegar, and a couple more onions. It definately got better as it sat, so I would recommend making it in the morning, or even the night before. Next time I will just use less sugar, and not being a fan of apple peel, I will peel them next time. That said, it's a definate keeper!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;poppytrail;5;This is a fantastic recipe! I added 1 tsp. vinegar to the mayo mix and topped the slaw off with dried crandberries and sliced almonds. My son had about 4 helpings and said be sure to keep the recipe for this one! I thought about adding some salad shrimp or chunks of chicken next time and make it a meal!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kimh;4;Some of the people loved it. Some thought it was o.k. You just can't please everyone all the time. I thought it was very good. Next time, I'll add extra dressing.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;blu3water;4;Very refreshing! This recipe is so versatile, you can add many crunchy fruits and veggies to it. I added fresh pineapple slices to mine, and a little bit of green onions. I love coleslaw and find this one to have a good balance of creaminess, sweetness and tanginess. Will definately make again.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;iminthekitchen;5;Everyone enjoyed this dish. Great twist on cole slaw with the addition of bell peppers, it gave it a nice flavor. Definitely will make this again.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;cynjams;5;Scrumptious! Everyone raved about this yummy twist on coleslaw. Instead of the lemon juice I used 1 tsp of apple cider vinegar. Thanks for the terrific recipe!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;kvn2003;5;This recipe is excellent. I've made it several times and am ALWAYS asked to bring it to family functions. I always buy a pre-shredded cabbage/carrot mixture to make prep easier and also change up the apples from time to time (try Fuji or Gala, you must keep the granny smith though for the tartness). I skip the red pepper and sometimes add a little extra dressing. This is WONDERFUL and keeps for several days. Thanks so much for a GREAT recipe, Aunt Mamie!!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;beaniej;5;Awesome recipe!!! I omitted the onions (as done by a previous reviewer) and added another carrot in their place. The whole family loved it - thanks!!
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;barbw;5;This is a great change from your standard slaw. I tried it with about a tablespoon of curry powder and that really kicked it up a notch. Try it if you like curry.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;myvintagemommy;3;This was ok, there was something weird about the mayo and brown sugar. I added lemon juice to keep the apples from turning brown.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;danielle34;4;This was very good. The guests enjoyed it and my 5 year old daughter loved it. I will say that it is NOT for traditionally cole slaw loving people. As it is very sweet! I served it to a Virginia man who was looking forward to some good slaw and he was a bit disappointed. However, I enjoyed it.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jessicanewalford;5;"Wonderful recipe! I don't care for ""common"" coleslaw, so the bit of sweetness was awesome! I took this dish to a potluck and it was a hit :) Thanks!"
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;chelmore;5;Terrific recipe. I volunteered to bring slaw to a fried chicken dinner, and this sounded so much better than mayo and cabbage. Everyone loved it. This will be a permanent addition to my repertoire.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;jackie32;5;This recipe was very good and quick. I cheated by using a bag of cole slaw mix and left out the onions and peppers. Next time I will try adding some celery also. Thanks for a great recipe.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;gailpageobrien;5;A nice change from regular cole slaw. Great way to use those nice fall apples.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;vivnidhi;4;The recipe is very good. Thanks. It tasted like the restaurant one.I think next time I will add some grapes as well, should add to the taste.
f7775d1e-14c8-49ce-82f5-3bb18bf623ea;bonf;5;We loved this cole slaw. It does not overdo the mayo like so many recipes. I think the apples and the dressing are a must as is, but you could add or subtract to the rest of it to fit your taste.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;siby;5;I love this! I have been making it for awhile. The only changes I make are cut the garlic powder back to half and instead of using brown sugar, I use Splenda, and also cut back on that. I serve it with rice and shrimp scampi.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;carolyng;5;This was easy and very flavorful. I doubled the ingredients as referenced by other reviewers. I did not have peanut butter so I used almond butter. Very delicious I will make it again!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;marciemahaffey;5;Very tasty. I Cut the garlic in half, and added diced chicken.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;paulawilson;5;Made the recipe exactly as mentioned. My husband loved it. Next time I may a little extra sauce. It was really good!!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;rodney;5;tried this as a side dish to my curried chicken with rice and peas Sunday dinner. kids loved it and i will be making it again. i did it with California mix and baby cabbages.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;primo;4;Good flavor, very easy to make. The sauce should probably be doubled, maybe because I had rice also. Not going to make the rotation, but it's a quick, simple dish that you can make in a time crunch. Could use a little spice.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;denise;5;Loved this recipe. I used fresh vegetables instead of frozen and also added some crushed red pepper for a little kick. Served over brown rice. The sauce is a great base for any stir fry.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;janicejones;5;The flavour exceeded my expectations given the simplicity of the recipe. I doubled the sauce.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;christyrattobixby;5;Wow this was a big hit tonight!! I did change it a bit, sauteed chicken in olive oil with garlic and one onion, then added the frozen veggies and sauteed them till tender and stirred in the sauce (used crunchy peanut butter for added crunch). Put it all over white rice and served! Just yummy! Will use brown rice next time! This is a must try recipe, with almost everything you need in your pantry! A+++
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;terri;5;I just made this recipe and I absolutely loved it!!! This is my new go to recipe for sure. I added chicken and it was delicious!!!!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;allyson;5;This recipe is so easy especially for those nights you really don't feel like cooking. And best yet it is items everyone has in there home. I added frozen and fresh veggies worked out perfectly. I doubled recipe. Absolutely loved it all around. Was so tasty!! Will definitely make again.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;sherry;4;Used a bag of frozen Asian vegetables and also added a can of baby corn. Doubled the sauce ingredients. Would have been dry without doing so.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;jdro;5;Super quick and tasty.. threw in some cooked ramen style noodles and chicken. Whole family, including picky kids, loved it!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;dollydoxy;5;Delish recipe! The sauce is great. I prepared the recipe a little differently. I made a pot of rice and set aside. I sautéed some frozen shrimp in a little butter with a sprinkle of garlic salt and set that aside, too. Then I followed the recipe, using 6 oz of frozen onions/peppers and 16 oz of frozen normandy vegetables. I used sauce recipe as stated but I did add 1/2 tsp of sesame oil. Stir fried vegetables just like recipe, tossed in the shrimp then added the sauce and folded together. Served it over the rice. Outstanding! Only thing I would do different is double that fantastic sauce.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;mumkatt;4;This was easy and great! Needed a bit extra salt and pepper and sesame oil but yum.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;ajboulanger;5;"I also made this 2 nights in a row. So easy. Appreciate recipes that don’t require buying ingredients I may never use again. The only substitutions were leaving out the peanut butter yesterday (added Spam to it-his choice) and using peanut oil rather than olive oil both times. Chicken was great in this, over white rice; increased the sauce by 50%. Yum! Keeper."
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;taylor;5;Delicious!! So we added cubed chicken breast and noodles,knowing this I doubled the sauce recipe to cover everything EXCEPT the garlic powder I only did 1 tsp.Threw some sesame seeds on it and little egg rolls as a side.It was so easy my 3 year old helped me with 95% of it.She was so proud of the dinner she cooked and it was so good and low cost..definitely going into the dinner rotation.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;jusgene;5;Really good basic recipe using things you already have in the pantry. I had real garlic so I used that in the sauce instead of powder. I am a big fan of Asian food and had some oyster sauce and added about 2T since I doubled the recipe. I liked a little spice so I heated 2 chiles de arbol in the oil before adding the veggies, water chestnuts and some onion. I like the sauce a little thicker so a little cornstarch helped it cling nicely. Served with rice and it was a hit! Thanks for the recipe!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;david;5;The sauce is so good. Definitely tastes Asian. I used a bag of frozen California Mix.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;dylanbollschweiler;5;Made it with beef, so good!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;leeann;5;Easy and tasty..make it all the time.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;ruthie;5;This was amazing and I loved how it was so easy to use as a dressing after everything was cooked. It was a big hit at my family gathering. We did use fresh vegetables along with some frozen. Combined it with cooked chicken and served with long grain rice. Will definitely save this recipe in my favorites.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;manda782;5;Amazing flavor! Well make again as main dish with chicken too!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;joycejohnson;5;This is really tasty. After my first time following the recipe, I’ve made a couple changes that suit our preferences - but it’s easy and delicious w/o any changes. I now make it substituting sesame oil and minced garlic, and adding about 2 tbs of finely chopped ginger. So simple on a week night, but so yummy too. I serve over rice or ramen noodles and sometimes add chopped or shredded chicken.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;gayle;5;Loved it, but doubled the sauce and used twice the peanut butter. I cooked the vegetables for about 3 minutes, added some water to the sauce mix and stirred it in for the last few minutes of cooking instead of at the end. Served it over quinoa as a vegetarian main dish.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;kimberlysiersdale;5;Easy to make and the sauce had a wonderful taste.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;uberchill;4;It was pretty good. I cut the recipe in half. I might use just a little bit less soy sauce next time but enjoyed it.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;christinasnook;4;Quick and easy recipe! I did not have peanut oil and I wished I did, I think it would have tasted better. I would add some garlic and onion to the oil next time. I would make it again.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;person;5;Absurdly easy. I had all the ingredients on hand. I just added an egg. I’d make it again.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;kiyanashird;5;I added twice the amount of sauce! AMAZING!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;angel;5;Loved it! Senior tweaks, Used two large salads and 2 side fresh veggies which were not being eaten due to crunchy skins and Seniors being 76, and 82 yr old with teeth problems. Cooked it for about 10 minutes to soften more. Added that delicious Thai type sauce! We loved it! Dont need take out now as we can make this out of leftover veggies on hand! That SAUCE! YUM! Thanks for this easy, easy, fast RECIPE!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;katecron;1;I was really excited about this recipe. But, no. I'm sorry, I just really didn't like it
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;nextdrhood;5;Yum! I followed the advice of other reviewers and sauteed cubed chicken with onion before adding the vegetables. I seasoned the chicken with a spicy seasoning salt (Slap Ya Mama) that gave the whole dish a nice kick. It made a great one-dish meal that I will definitely repeat.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;phoenixplays;5;I made this and I’m allergic to garlic but it still tastes great! I added jalapeños and cucumbers and tomatoes and mushrooms and broccoli and it was AMAZING!!!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;doodlebug;5;I made this with raw vegetables, I par boiled carrot & broccoli before hand for just a couple of mins before adding to stir fry. I used almond butter instead of PB, added red pepper flakes and served over a bed of rice. My Hubs and I both loved this, the red pepper made it a bit spicier and the almond butter was tasty. I used whatever veggies i had, broccoli, carrots, red onion, mushrooms and celery
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;michelle;5;Holy smokes was this good. Nowadays need dishes that stretch the ol budget. I added some steak strips and cut the pieces really small. Served it over rice. Stay healthy everyone. Take care of each other and yourselves.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;anuamarnath;5;So good! I'm allergic to peanuts so I subbed sunflower seed butter, which worked great. I also added some sriracha for a little heat. This is my go to stir fry recipe now!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;joshjones;5;It came out very flavorful and tasty definitely will make again
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;cieradunn;5;I didn't use peanut Butter but it was still amazing without it
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;dbrohr;5;Love this super easy and yummy recipe. Made exactly as written, just added stir-fry beef. Love that you can use frozen vegetables and all ingredients are things I already have in the pantry.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;kinley;5;Súper easy and turned out great! I added fresh mushrooms, zucchini, bok choy and suteed onions as recommended by others. I will definitely be making this again.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;tammyg;5;Fantastic recipe! It was easy to prepare and delicious. My husband loved it. I combined fresh and frozen veggies.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;mark;2;Not enough taste/flavor.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;charlesbrienza;3;Interesting flavor. Not bad, just not great either. It’s a good change of pace from the norm but not something I’d crave.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;junehowarth;5;I love this!!! We double the sugar and peanut butter but do the rest the same. We add chicken and put it on rice or rice noodles for a quick and delicious dinner. We have also just made the veggies as a side. We eat this at least once a week as I love it so much!!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;pjnadeau;5;This is so simple it’s hard to believe. Fantastic flavor. I cooked up a couple chicken breasts and a 1.5 cups of rice. Doubled the recipe. It was fantastic.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;kristineruff;5;Delicious! We are a very picky family when it involves veggies. We all loved this. I used a pkg of frozen stir-fry veggies from Sam’s Club. I did double the recipe to feed the four of us, and will probably make it again with veggies, chicken, and rice.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;laurarisdall;5;Even my picky kids loved it! We added day-old rice.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;jenniferrenees;4;I really liked this recipe! I used crunchy peanut butter because that's what I had and it actually may have made it even better. My friend gave it a 4/5 and is picky with his veggies and doesn't really like soy sauce. I'd make them again. A good Asian side dish. The next day I ate it with rooster garlic and chile sauce and little green onions. That was really good too. I really liked the kick. I think this recipe would also be really good with plain chicken mixed in and whole peanuts. I want to try that next time!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;sid;5;yummy. Followed the recipe. added seafood
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;martha;5;Super simple to make. I took all the leftover fresh vegetables in my fridge ,doubled the sauce, cuz I had a lot of veggies and it came out great!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;romulus;5;Great recipe! Made exactly what was shown for 3 people, but it wasn't quite enough and we were all still a bit hungry after. Next time we'll double the recipe for sure! Worked just fine as a main dish, could probably toss in chicken as well if you miss the meat but it doesn't need it. Goes great with rice and frozen pot stickers.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;aestep;5;So quick and easy!! I added cooked and peeled shrimp to the veggies. I doubled the recipe (big family) and also added a tablespoon of orange marmalade to the sauce mixture then mixed everything together with spaghetti noodles. Family absolutely loves it, definitely will be making again soon.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;wctkat;5;Perfectly fast, Simple and delicious. It is a new staple for us!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;tonibarker;4;Turned out good. No substitutions.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;hcb01;5;Great sauce. Made it exactly as recipe states. I actually made more because it seemed like a small amount at first but a little goes a long way! You do not need thickly coat the veggies, a light covering is DELISH. Definitely going to make again. A+++
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;callieconnolly;5;Will definitely make again. I doubled the recipe since I added a pound of fajita chicken and served over rice.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;dianan;5;This was a quick & tasty side dish - made exactly as written. Will be including this in our (side dish) rotation!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;lisadelacruz;5;Super easy, delicious, and quick!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;sue;5;I use reduced fat peanut butter, low sodium soy sauce and brown sugar blend.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;addles;4;This was yummy but even doubling the sauce it still seemed like it needed more. Next time I’ll make a bigger batch of sauce.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;kristinwhitekvastad;4;This was really simple and uses ingredients most people have on hand. I’d recommend throwing in a bit of ginger (fresh or ground), sesame oil, and fresh green onions once cooked. But as-is- nice flavor. Use up those tired old bags of frozen veg from the freezer- that’s what I did! ??
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;deontelee;4;this is really good! I doubled the recipe but kept the peanut butter at 2 tbsp. I sauteed an onion first, cooked 2 chicken breast in the onion along with garlic, then dropped in the frozen veggies. it's definitely worth a try
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;valeriemachmer;5;Can it get any easier ?!?! I never made stir fry and this turned out delicious. I used chicken 1st time around, and set it aside (and dashed it with some soy sauce as it sauted). Very easy to open the bag of stir fry veggies and put them in ... as they warmed up I added the recipe ingredients and made rice in a separate dish. At the end, I mixed in the chicken and put it on a bed of rice ... YUM! 2nd batch I used pre-cooked salad shrimp along with the chicken as a test ... they do get small when warmed up but what yummy gems!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;cdsgro;5;I doubled this recipe, added chicken and red pepper flakes. Put it over brown rice. This was delicious. Everyone loved it! Will be adding this to our meal planning.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;michichgo;5;I made this for lunch today, as directed, and it was absolutely delicious!!!!!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;judyozzy;5;Awesomely awesome! I cut up a chicken breast in small cubes and cooked it first. Removed it from the pan and added the frozen vegetables. Cook with garlic salt and pepper then add the chicken and sauce. I also added some ginger and srirachi to the sauce and some of the rice water to thin the sauce a little then added it to the pan. Unexpectedly good!!!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;efoster;5;Family really enjoyed this dish. I will be making it again.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;amybuchmeier;5;Other than adding chicken, I followed the recipe exactly (doubled so I could feed everyone). Excellent!! Will definitely be making this one again.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;mkowals2;5;This recipe is surprisingly delicious as-is (just using a frozen vegetable mix) but the real gem is the sauce. We've used it in other stir fries, with and without chicken/rice, and it always turns out amazing. Only modification we sometimes make is to shred some ginger into the sauce, but it's delicious both ways.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;doctorte;5;I used sesame oil instead of olive. Like some of the others, I sautéed onions and garlic before adding the vegetables. Since this was to be a complete meal, I sautéed sliced chicken breast with the onion and garlic. Added bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, and mushrooms to the vegetables. Great supper!

05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;jimg;4;Just happened to get Thai-style frozen veggies on sale this week & was excited to test this recipe.....better than I Could have hoped for....this recipe is a definite keeper!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;tawnylee;5;Made exactly as listed, with mixed frozen vegetables and diced mushrooms. So much better than it sounded. Will definitely do again. Used sesame oil and olive oil for cooking.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;kturner;5;I love this sauce on freshly chopped & stir fried veggies!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;nona;5;Followed recipe just as written. Doubled the sauce because I added some chicken. Passed the husband test when he declared this is a keeper. Will definitely make again. Love how quick it is to make.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;sue;5;OMG, this was so good!! I don't like vegetables and I will definitely be making this as often as I can get away with. I followed the recipe exactly as it's written. I may add onions next time but it's great without it.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;mjd;5;So easy! I followed recipe except I added some cut up cooked chicken breast. Since I made this for myself I had enough leftover for 3-4 meals. Last time I made a stir fry I cut up Fresh vegetables.. I may make stir fry with frozen veg all the time. Good sauce!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;csiebsen;5;Awesome. Makes pretty bland vegetables into something everybody likes. Wasn't anything left after dinner
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;foraker4;4;The peanut butter and brown sugar combination gave it some great flavor!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;maureenmccormick;4;Loved it! Even there are no hot spices in the ingredients, it does leave a slight spicy taste on your tounge.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;feliciashontay;5;I'm sold! It Is very tasty. My 11 year old son loves it and he even asked for seconds, he never does that with vegetables. Definitely making it again tomorrow...... I added sautated onions and put only one teaspoon of garlic powder... Best stir fried veggies I've ever made
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;nicoleswete;5;Everybody loved it! Easy to make too!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;toni;5;Used Asian blend of frozen veg. Garlic to taste. A few extra fresh veg. Excellent recipe, lots of variations possible.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;swhitfield;4;So easy! I eyeballed everything and used minced garlic instead of garlic powder in the sauce. And when I was cooking my vegetables I put black pepper, crushed red pepper, and garlic powder on them and then added the sauce.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;anneh;5;Very tasty. I used sesame oil instead of olive oil. I used half the sugar & doubled the quantity. . I used mostly fresh veggies since I had them on hand. I added straw mushrooms, water chestnuts & a little leftover roasted pork. Hubby liked it so will make again.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;cahardin64;4;We thought this was great. The sauce is really good. We did add chicken to it.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;jcarter;5;I made this tonight. My Husband loved it! I liked that it's quick and easy and can be made after an 8 hrs day at the office. Will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;bookbet;5;Sauce tastes great. Next time I might increase it if I want a saucy side to serve with rice.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;danelle;5;Dumped a huge bag in my biggest non stick pan. Cooked about 10 minutes, doubled the sauce. Perfect.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;taranso;4;I really enjoyed the peanut sauce. I would recommend!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;kd;5;So good, and so easy!! The whole family loved it. Made it exactly as written and it was perfect. I might add some red pepper flakes next time for a little kick. Thank you, Tracey!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;bex;5;I had intended to make this with the frozen vegetables, but ended up buying fresh vegetables instead. I doubled the sauce recipe and also added chicken. The sauce is really the main point of this dish, so I still felt I could give an honest and fair review. It was absolutely delicious!! This was the best stir fry I've ever made. The sauce was absolutely perfect!! It wasn't overly garlicky, and it was not a heavy sauce. I will definitely use this every time I make stir fry!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;melina;5;Super easy and delicious! Only modification I made was a hit of ground ginger and a pinch of red pepper flakes for a little heat. Really great recipe!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;joylewis01;4;Good stuff! I doubled the sauce & veggies, added minced garlic, shrimp & eggs. I added siracha to the sauce and extra soy sauce. delish!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;shannonmarie;5;I'm on a kick for peanut butter sauces and man does this nail! So delicious, creamy and was just what I was looking for! ????However, I didn't add the brown sugar as for me and what I wanted didn't feel the need to add it so I left it out
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;wolfpackfan;5;This was pretty good and so easy. I added more soy sauce after tasting it - next time I'll just double the sauce, since I thought it needed more for the rice. Also added a healthy amount of red chili flakes for kick!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;pbean;4;Also doubled recipe, added a can of pineapple, chicken, onion, zucchini, cayenne pepper, dijon mustard. Great because of basic on-hand ingredients, ease of prep, and pretty good taste. For me did not come out too sweet or garlicky. My son and I both added some soy sauce at the table.... Would like to try with the cornstarch suggestion. Still needs some zing.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;anne;5;This makes a delicious and easy vegan meal!!! I used low-sodium soy sauce and increased the peanut butter to about 2 tablespoons. I will make this quick sauce over and over, it goes great on steamed broccoli, potatoes, almost anything really! Love it!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;gretaefferson;3;Good flavor but waaaayy too much garlic. I cant stop tasting it and it's been hours.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;ellekay;5;Delicious, but definitely eat while hot.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;angela;5;Outstanding. Made it exactly as the recipe specified. Looking forward to trying with many other vegetable combinations and maybe some added meats.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;dennis;5;Quick and easy to make. I added strips of beef to the recipe and added a little olive oil to the sauce to make it more liquid. The peanut butter takes it out of the ordinary.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;mandirossberg;5;"My husband is super picky about homemade stir fry, and this won the day! I added chicken and served over rice; it was amazing! I would double the recipe if serving more than two people though, but this is going to be a regular on our table!"
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;charliebenders;5;The sauce is delicious, I quadrupled it because I used a ton of frozen vegetables along with a can each of pineapple, mushrooms, and water chestnuts. I also baked chicken breast with some garlic and soy sauce, sliced it up and mixed it in. Everyone loved it!!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;frinkel1;5;The only thing I changed was to cut the garlic powder in half. This was absolutely marvelous
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;pepperdoo;5;This is my go-to stir fry sauce. Gives lots of flavour ( I usually use fresh veggies), and it's easy enough for my 11 year old to make while I chop and fry veggies. Love it!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;teight;4;Super simple and good. Used half garlic powder half minced garlic. Mixed with some plain white rice and it was great!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;sheri413;5;Very good as is! I kept the sauce separate from the veggies for my picky family, and drizzled it on my peas and carrots. So good, and my super-picky son even liked dipping his corn-dog in it. This makes maybe a quarter-cup of sauce, but it's plenty of flavor.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;lvsandoval;5;These go perfectly with my fish and chicken. I looked up this recipe last second and had everything on hand. I was able to prepare the sauce while the veggies cooked. The only change I made was using honey instead of brown sugar because I'm not a fan of adding actual sugar to food if it isn't necessary. My boyfriend loved it! He drained the sauce on his vegetable. Whatever works.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;cait18;5;made it with fresh vegetables chicken and almonds over rice. My third time eating it this week. love it!!!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;emily;5;Great recipe! I loved the sauce, simple list of ingredients and fits into my version of healthy. I used 10 oz of frozen stir fry veg with one package of Quorn's chicken chunks. For future stir fries, I I've collected my favorite fresh & frozen veggies and packed them into 12 oz bags that are ready to pull out of the freezer.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;daniellemansfield;4;I tripled the recipe using 2 lbs of frozen vegetables, 1 lb of chicken, added a little powdered ginger, and reduced the garlic powder as some other reviewers suggested. It was super easy, very quick, and tasty. I'll definitely make this again.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;ldavido;4;used 24 oz frozen vegetables and doubled sauce, added onion and some leftover chickpeas (would maybe triple next time)
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;kcooking;5;I made this exactly as it is written and it was very very good. A nice side dish that is very quick and easy to put on the table. I will be making it again.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;mrsmom;4;Doubled sauce and added about a lb of chicken thigh.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;smj3ze;4;Instead of olive oil, I used sesame seed oil. i sauteed fresh garlic, added fresh broccoli and carrots, and steamed them until tender. I then pushed the veggies to the sides of the pan to make room in the center to quickly scramble a few eggs and add to the mixture. i then added the sauce and leftover turkey breast from thanksgiving and stirred until warm. delicious!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;amandaweigner;4;I already have it memorized! So good & my boyfriend was a big fan but I had to make a couple batches of sauce.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;shannajohnston;5;Very quick, easy & delicious. I used 1/2 the garlic powder & added Turkey kielbasa before the veggies. Will definitely cook again.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;erinhepner;5;Great flavor and sauce. I think it's closer to 4 servings than 6. i added chicken to bulk it up and make it more filling. I will definitely make if more and often.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;aplateofgrapes;4;Tasty and quick. I used minced garlic rather than the powder and a little less soy sauce than recommended.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;laurelnicol;4;Healthy, quick and easy - the triple crown!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;coraaalll;5;I am 12 years old! I decided one night to make my family dinner and saw this it looked very tasty and delicious so I gave it a go. It turned out to be AMAZING! Thank you so much for this recipe.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;barbfoley;5;Trying new dishes. I made the Frozen Vegetable Stir Fry. It's a Thai style side dish. It was really good because the taste of the sauce wasn't overpowering like you get in a Thai restaurant. DH & I both loved it. Will make it again. I used frozen veg.'s. Only change I made was less garlic, and added some fresh green peppers out of our garden. Next time we're going to try it with just all fresh veg.'s and just add the sauce. I think it would be good either way. Just to add I had the side dish with baked potatoes made in my new pressure cooker and chicken breast. I made the potatoes and the chicken in the pressure cooker and cooked 20 min.'s. Excellent meal. (It would be good over rice also.)
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;jeffreywilson;5;Absolutely perfect !!!! I did sliced top sirloin sautéed with minced garlic in olive oil until almost cooked then added veggies and followed recipe. Wife and I loved it and 4 outta 5 of the kids ??
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;khank;5;Very easy and stuck to instructions and listed ingredients. came out great. wonderful base. whole family including 2 yr old liked this recipe.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;autumnsmidt;3;tastes very processed but still not awful
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;kallentide;5;This sauce is excellent. I usually make a lot more of it though so we can really coat everything, including the rice bed I serve it on.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;shandelljones;5;Perfect, but needed some heat for my liking. As many I was hesitate, but thought I'd give it whirl because I love Thai food. Added some shrimp for protein and served over brown rice. I like spicy so added some sriracha, next time I'll add some cayenne pepper. Even without the extra heat has a great flavor as written.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;meatcookingveg;4;My husband loved it. I made a bit more of the sauce mixture.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;allrecipescommunity;5;I triple the sauce mixture (except only double the sugar), add two cut up chicken breasts and an extra bag of frozen veggies. I also substitute with regular garlic and occasionally add fresh ginger. I serve it with brown rice and it is great! This is a perfect quick, easy, and healthy meal! I keep frozen vegetables and cut up frozen chicken on hand so it's great for when you don't plan ahead! We have been eating it weekly!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;hisangel13;5;I doubled the recipe and added cornstarch, water, spicy mustard to the sauce, sautéed chicken in garlic and served over multi grain rice- so far no complaints even from my picky 6 year old
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;seamonkey76;5;We really love the sauce for this. The last time I made it I added red pepper flakes. I haven't tried with frozen vegetables, just whatever fresh I have on hand at the time.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;mary;5;Loved this marinade! So simple, and tastes so good.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;brooke;4;Pretty good starter recipe. I think it is important to mention that as you are using frozen veggies, you really must drain the extra water before adding the sauce. Speaking of sauce, I doubled recipe ( was needed) and used crunchy peanut butter to give texture. Turned out great. Will do my own personal tweaking but this was a great gateway recipe!! Thank you!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;qkilrain;5;I added chicken and served with Fried Rice I on this site.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;shellgirlfl;5;I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect! My family loved it and it was so easy to make....and delicious!!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;teresaottaviani;5;Super quick and totally awesome flavor! This one is a hit for sure! I followed it exactly except I heated the flavor mix on medium low and added pepper. This seasoning would go good on just about anything! I'm going to give it a shot on chicken on the grill this summer! Wow, I'm so glad I ran across this one! Just make it, you won't regret it!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;samantha;5;I added a pack of ramen noodles and I didn't have soy sauce so I substituted balsamic vinegar and the chicken flavor packet in the sauce. It turned out GREAT!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;robertjackson;4;GREAT recipe!!! Made the recipe as is, no changes.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;lindabellisonhollis;5;Awesome recipe! Love the flavor AND the simplicity. I fried up some tofu, doubled the sauce and served over brown rice noodles. Good stuff! Going into my regular rotation.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;johnl;5;I really like the peanut butter adder for flavor and adding the sauces after all veggies and chicken have been cooked makes them cook better and flavor is more fresh. john
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;danalevy;5;I made this recipe for my very picky 81 year old mother who never tries anything new. She actually had seconds! I made the recipe pretty much as directed but added a little more garlic and peanut butter. I like it a little stronger. Next time I might try the sauteed onions that someone suggested and/or chicken and rice. Excellent dish.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;dillemma9;3;Good sauce for ads might with varied taste. My husband doesn't like too spicy...myself? Nothing ever spicy enough. We both added liquid aminos (soy sauce substitute) and I added a dollop of chili garlic sauce to add the needed kick in my bowl:) I'll use less sugar next time and perhaps a hit of rice vinegar....overall solid base to add flavor to according to personal preference.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;aliciamarie;5;Did this exactly as recipe said and wow!! Very yummy. Add stir fried chicken and toss w cooked Thai style noodles for a full meal!! Yum!!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;andrea;5;"Very flavorful ingredient combination. Quick and easy to make, which is perfect for busy weeknights. Will definitely add this to my ""make often"" list! Update: I've made this numerous times now, and we always love eating these vegetables. However, as much as we love garlic, tonight I decided to halve the garlic amount. These came out better than ever! This is one of our favorite recipes for vegetables."
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;corrie25;4;Delicious! Needed some salt & I added just a little bit of sesame seed oil. Loved the way the peanut butter added to the flavor profile.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;anna;5;Added some chicken, doubled the sauce recipe and added about a quarter cup of Sriracha. Delicious!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;jbrandon2;5;Very tasty and easy as is or just simple enough to change as needed by adding chicken or beef to the mix as well. You can have it on rice, noodles, or even alone! This is going to become a staple in our household.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;masithma;5;Perfect easy delicious dish! Great flavor, and super simple. I changed a couple things. I wanted to make this the main dish so I started by sautéing onions & chicken thighs (cut into small pieces), until chicken was cooked thru. And i didn't have frozen veggies so I just used fresh: added yellow orange and red bell peppers and zucchini to the chicken. Also added slivered almonds which was a nice addition! Then once all that was cooked, took off heat and added the sauce, which I did exactly as recipe called for. But I tripled the sauce, and it turned out to be the perfect amount for how much I made. Served over rice. This turned out so good!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;kraig;5;Great stir fry sauce!! Much better than a packet.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;gderrthedysfunctional;4;after making this, I let the wife taste it...bad idea. she begin adding more peanut butter. I'm not a fan. so I then had to doctor it. then she comes back from bathroom and... the battle was on.I did add more garlic powder. seriously, it does need minor tweaks for taste, but very good stuff.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;onpointe;4;I really like this, a bit too much garlic powder, but other than that, delicious! We served it over jasmine rice, easy and yum!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;heathernewcom;5;I made it with chicken. Cooked frozen chicken in the oil. I then added the frozen veggies. I have a bag of frozen stir fry veggies, so I didn't have to add anything else. Cooked the veggies about 12 mins with the chicken. Took off heat and added the sauce mixture. From previous reviewers I added a touch of garlic but not a ton and a little bit more peanut butter. It came out great you would never think everything came frozen. Serve over Jasmine rice! Yummy! I will make this one again!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;meganriley;5;I just so happened to have all of these ingredients on hand, so I whipped this recipe together and was surprised at how delicious and simple it was! Won't take long at all and it tastes amazing. I didn't change a thing.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;leahpeterson;5;This will be a new go-to recipe in our house! I gotta admit- I did change up the ratio of the sauce. More peanut butter and more brown sugar, but only because I favor very sweet asian dishes and sauces. I also added stir fry beef as a protein. The actual ratios in the recipe would have been fine, too. One tip- when you add the frozen veggies there is some moisture that collects at the bottom of the pan. You can either drain that before adding the sauce for a more thickly coated stir fry, or you can leave it and have a more liquidy sauce that soaks nicely into some white rice! This is probably the easiest meal I've ever made. Really, it's easier than hamburger helper or even DRIVING to a restaurant! And for such a simple, affordable recipe that requires several ingredients that I almost always have on hand, its flavors were interesting and quite complex. I will be making this again, 100 times over. Delicious!!!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;michelleaguilar;4;Excellent sauce. Liked it very muh.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;stanstan009;5;5 Stars! This is gold. This is one of the very few recipes that is good as is (and this is coming from a guy who likes to tweak recipes and go off the books). I was little apprehensive when I saw the peanut butter in the recipe, but this was SO delicious and SO easy to make. Instead of using frozen veggies, I used whatever fresh veggies I had in the house (mushrooms, onions, celery, bell peppers, etc.) and added chicken. Yum! The sauce is sweet, but also savory. A few other reviewers have suggested adding spice (like maybe Cayenne pepper) to the recipe if you want to go with a 'sweet and spicy' flavor instead. I might add some barbecue sauce to this next time to go for a BBQ chicken/veggie stir fry! Pro tip: If you have extra sauce, save it and use it as salad dressing the next day!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;tiffany;5;Wow, this recipes was sooo good. I did change a few things. I doubled the sauce. I used the garlic powder that was called for but, I think it was a little much (and I love garlic). I do not usually cook with frozen veggies so I cut up 2 small heads of broccoli, 1 yellow squash, 1 zucchini and 1/2 of a yellow onion. Just before it was done, I added half a can of peas 1/2 can of carrots (just what I happened to have on hand). This came out so delicious, even the kids loved it!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;keonna;5;I really loved this recipe. I added a teaspoon of ground ginger and I used fresh minced garlic. A good way to get the kids to eat their veggies!!!!!!!!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;torybreise;5;Never would have thought to add peanut butter. I followed the recipe with great results.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;erin;5;My kids don't usually like stir fry but they loved this recipe. I love that it is super easy and fast to prepare.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;michaeld;5;Made this stir-fry tonight with grilled asian chicken and fried rice. It was awsome!!! I did use fresh vegetables however, i.e. broccoli, red bell pepper, onion, celery and water chestnuts. I was going to use fresh garlic but I forgot it (didn't miss it a bit), after stir frying the vegetables I added a small amount of water covered and steamed for a few minutes, added the water chestnuts in the last minute to heat them. This is now my go to stir-fry recipe. I have been looking for a good one for a long time, but the search is over. Thanks for sharing.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;jnlefor;4;Great recipe!!! I usually add more veggies and some shrimp to it also. I double the sauce and add some ginger for extra flavor. Quick meal with great taste!!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;liss7700;5;My husband LOVED it! Thank you for the recipe! He said its award winning and asked me to make a second serving! :D
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;tonilosada;5;So easy maybe easiest dinner ever, I double the sauce and sometime add half a can of coconut milk yuummmm..need to triple next time love the leftovers
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;anna;4;I liked the easy way with which this sauce came together. If you are looking for a quick and easy recipe, this is it. Will definitely try this again. It would be even better with fresh vegetables as the frozen ones are not crisp but rather soft.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;amber00;5;Wow! This was my first time making stir-fry. I used a 1 lb bag of Great Value stir-fry vegetables, and added 5 boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I substituted the olive oil for vegetable oil and garlic powder for garlic salt, since that was what I had on hand. I also added just a small bit of cornstarch to thicken up the sauce. I served it over white rice, and it turned out phenomenal!! I will be adding this to my quick weeknight go-to recipes! I love how easy and cost efficient this meal is. Thanks for the great recipe! :)
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;emerald3;5;Made this tonight :) first cooking for my boyfriend... It came out yummy ! I used steak and i use fresh veggies and whole grain rice :)
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;michellebungay;5;I cannot stand frozen veggie stir fry. My husband made it, I rolled my eyes, sat down to dinner without much enthusiasm, and was quite surprised. I love this sauce so much that we have stir fry almost weekly and since I don't have access to frozen veggies anymore (we live in Costa Rica now) I even go through all the effort to chop fresh veggies for it. We also serve the stir fried veggies with the sauce over rice. My husband likes his with chicken so we make that for him to add on the side. Makes a really easy meal for families that are part vegetarian and part carnivore! I agree that you need to double the sauce for a family of four.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;ingy90;5;Very fast, easy and family friendly. Will make this in a pinch.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;deannagibson;5;I just make the sauce from the recipe, but the whole family loves it! I double everything, substitute 2 fresh cloves of garlic for the garlic powder and add a healthy shake of cayenne for a bit of a kick. Delicious!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;pz1172;4;Very good, just a little too much garlic for me (woke up in the middle of the night still tasting it). So next time I will only use 1 tsp of garlic powder. Otherwise, this was wonderful with an Asian veggie mix and some tofu fried in coconut oil. Yum!!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;guerrabrian;4;This turned out great. I was a bit apprehensive of the peanut butter, but it made for a nice sauce and the consistency seemed just right. My 2 year old even liked it. In lieu of all frozen vegetables, I used an assortment of fresh and frozen vegetables: assorted bell peppers, cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, frozen peas. I also added some sesame tempeh. All in all, this was a really easy recipe and it took very little time. I also added crushed peanuts. As for the rice, I've fallen in love with organic, microwavable rice (ready in 90 seconds), which cuts total time (and effort) significantly. Cheers!!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;todde;5;Incredibly easy way to make a very healthy meal. Could use a little more flavor, but still excellent idea.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;taza27;5;Tripled this and used for a chicken, veggie, rice noodle stir-fry and my family loved it! Thank you!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;tamzon;5;Perfect taste & super easy to whip-up! We'll definitely be making this again. Thank you! :D
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;laurennickerson;4;This was good. It was a bit sweet for my taste but easily fixable with a bit less brown sugar. Very good overall!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;tracywingfield;5;Awesome! Kids loved it. Quick and easy. Versatile.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;lenae;5;Yum! New family fav! Used half the peanut butter. Added flour, a little water, and red pepper flakes. Also threw meat and chopped walnuts to the stir fry. Awesomeness.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;nvorel;3;Very good recipe, quick and easy. Although, I thought the garlic powder was way too much and I love garlic. I will half the g powder next time. Will try adding water chestnuts next time.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;tomo;5;Wow! So simple, so delicious. I might create a second allrecipes account so I can give it another 5 stars.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;chubbycheekers;4;This recipe was really tasty! I made no modifications and my 3-year-old gobbled it up. The leftovers even reheated well. I served it over white rice.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;brittneynicolelanpher;5;This recipe was very good!! My two small children even liked it (6 yrs old & 2 yrs old). The only thing I did differently was that I doubled the ingredients for the sauce. I didn't think it had enough flavor without doubling it and it was a little dry. VERY TASTY THOUGH!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;beccabeauty25;4;Great Recipe! It's easy and very few ingredients which I like! I added some pasta to make it more of a meal and adding chicken would make it a great meal too. Great basic sauce though!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;elizabeths;4;Easy! I changed it up a bit: started with chopped onions and then added minced garlic. In my sauce, I boosted up the spice with some sriracha sauce (to taste). I also added some chicken I baked with cayenne pepper, paprika, red pepper, and salt/pepper. Yum! I would venture to add less peanut butter next time. I read it as tablespoons! No wonder. Still good though!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;joanne;5;So good and so quick! Only changes I made were adding a squirt of spicy dijon to the sauce and adding some leftover cooked chicken breast to the mix! Served with jasmine rice. Super easy supper and tasted amazing!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;kimicole;5;add 1T plum sauce, pepper, sauteed onion. Mark says best stirfry
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;carabiniero8;5;Quick. Simple and delicious. That's all there is to it! I would make a bit more sauce next time because I like my stir fry coated thickly, but this was just the right amount to taste the flavor without seeing a lot of sauce on the stir fry. I recommend low sodium soy sauce and perhaps a bit less garlic powder, but otherwise this recipe is perfect!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;lisawi;4;So easy and good! I doubled the sauce and added chicken leftover from a rotisserie.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;mikiokiuraspallina;5;Really good and easy!! I used fresh vegetables and cut up chicken. Also pinch of red pepper to sauce :)
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;elizabethblairhenry;5;WOW! This is so good!! I followed the recipe but I added only a tsp garlic powder instead of 2 tsp. Going to keep this forever!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;suzanne;2;I was excited to try this, since it is made with regular frozen mixed vegetable. It was very simple, and I thought it was a nice change. But my husband and daughter were not impressed. I wonder if anyone has an easy suggestion to liven it up a bit?
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;clsimmon1908;5;Tasty and Low fat
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;jchester;5;"Followed a few tips & added what we had, but the basic recipe is KILLER! Doubled the sauce recipe, since I was adding sliced, leftover 'Roasted Pork Loin' (from AR) & some of its jus. Cooked it in a 'stir-fry pan', after sauteing minced garlic & the leftover pork in EVOO. Then followed the recipe. Served it over brown rice & my wife said, ""We never need to order Asian delivery food again!"" Can't wait to try it with chicken & shrimp!!!"
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;jwfy;4;Followed sauce recipe. It was very good but we did notice a slight bitterness/bite to it. I am not sure what would cause that, based on ingredients. Next time I may try a little more sugar. I did use a 14 oz bag of frozen stir-fry vegetables and served over brown rice. Unless you are serving this to people with very small appetites, it would never feed 6! My wife and I finished this by ourselves. Very easy & quick to prepare.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;jgeezy;5;Very forgiving recipe, would cut down on the soy sauce next time to reduce the sodium
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;my3boys;5;Wow this was a big hit tonight!! I did change it a bit, sauteed chicken in olive oil with garlic and one onion, then added the frozen veggies and sauteed them till tender and stirred in the sauce (used crunchy peanut butter for added crunch). Put it all over white rice and served! Just yummy! Will use brown rice next time! This is a must try recipe, with almost everything you need in your pantry! A+++
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;laurenkilgore;5;This was delicious! I doubled the sauce and added approximately a cup and a half of day old brown rice. I also added a can of drained water chestnuts and crushed red pepper. I think this is going to become a weekly staple! I absolutely loved that I could used frozen veggies and typical household ingredients to make this ethnic-style dish.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;lisapernatrier;5;This was amazing and super easy! I doubled the recipe since we served it over brown rice and used chunky peanut butter for texture. We also mixed fresh and frozen veggies. This dish was a hit with everyone and that's a tough thing to do!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;lolok;5;YUM! I doubled this recipe since I was also using chicken and rice, and it was sooooo good! I didn't have brown sugar, so I used regular white sugar and it still tasted amazing. I got so many compliments on my food. At first when I mixed the sauce together It looked disgusting (lol) and I was hesitant to mix it in with the food, but I'm glad I went ahead and did it, because it was fantastic. The dish looked like regular chinese food with the sauce. 'Twas amazing. Give it a try.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;recyclability;5;This recipe came out so good the first time, I had to try it again the next week. I love how easy it was to put together, and that I already had all of the ingredients in the kitchen. Instead of adding it to the vegetables, I mixed it into the chicken. The flavor is phenomenal regardless of whether you add it while the chicken is cooking or off the heat.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;davidvogtmann;5;This is an amazing recipe for anyone who enjoys Thai food. It is well deserving of the 5 stars. To satisfy my personal taste i added some cayenne pepper for some heat and used fresh vegetables. I would have uploaded a picture but it didn't stay on the plate that long. Amazing!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;barbaramichaelstout;5;This is a very forgiving recipe... I did it all wrong... I put the oil and sauce ingredients in first and then threw the frozen veggies in on top. It still tastes great. I added a few shakes of powdered ginger in in too.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;andreaelena;5;I was looking for a simple side dish to go along with the Ginger Glazed Mahi Mahi that I made (Also on this site and totally awesome). I am usually a bit of an All recipes snob. If it doesn't have at least 100 reviews I pass it up. And no picture?! I won't even glance at it. I'm so glad I did because this is now a staple in our dinner line up. It's really easy and full of flavor. I think next time I may add beef like another reviewer did and make this a main dish!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;schmidde;4;Great! I cooked ground beef first, then added it to the vegetables before stirring in the sauce. It tasted amazing and was super easy. What a great recipe that uses ingredients I almost always have on hand! I will definitely make this again.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;brandistogsdill;4;I tried this last night and liked it so much I'm making it again tonight! I did however do some things differently. I used a combination of fresh and thawed frozen vegetables and added some onion. I sauteed 1/4 of an onion in the skillet first with 1 teaspoon of garlic power. Then I tossed in the veggies. For the sauce I used only a small amount (approximately an 1/8 of a teaspoon) of garlic and I added some black pepper. When I make this again tonight I'm going to add a small amount of spicy mustard to the sauce. Though the sauce is good on it's own I personally think it could use a kick. I also think adding water and cornstarch or flour to the sauce and letting it cook until thickened (rather than adding it before serving) would also add a little something too. This is perfect pared with jasmine rice, tofu, and an egg roll!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;lynnmck;5;Great recipe! I had all the ingredients on hand and it was so simple to do. Next time I would increase the amount of veggies because there was plenty of flavor and throw in some cooked chicken or shrimp.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;juniperblyth;4;Tried this tonight for something different and I loved it! Even my family loved it. I will admit, next time I'll cut back on the garlic a little bit. I don't know if it's the brand I use but it was very garlicy. Overall, a good recipe and I will be making it again.
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;michellenelson;5;This was great! I can't wait to use it again. I didn't have any soy sauce but was determined to make this. I used the sub of 4 tsp Worcestershire sauce mixed with 1 tsp water (thanks to allrecipes for the suggestion). I also, I didn't want to use garlic powder, I used 1 heaping tsp of minced garlic. Great!
05a17068-9779-4c0c-9d63-3492b1a5ebfa;bjdawes;5;Super easy way to spice up frozen stir fry veggies. Whole family enjoyed.
e3a45a4c-8661-409f-b1c0-5a6fa43f39ce;larrytaylor;5;Very good, just enough of each ingredient. Tastes great, thanks
e3a45a4c-8661-409f-b1c0-5a6fa43f39ce;btoor0330;5;Loved the recipe I added 1/2 cup cut okra. O my goodness soooo delicious. I paired it with stove old fashion corn bread, baked fish and rice
e3a45a4c-8661-409f-b1c0-5a6fa43f39ce;cindy;5;Used up an abundance of tomatoes and peppers from my garden. Delicious! Did not even need to thicken with cornstarch.
e3a45a4c-8661-409f-b1c0-5a6fa43f39ce;marksperling;5;Added garlic!!!
e3a45a4c-8661-409f-b1c0-5a6fa43f39ce;greg;5;My husband and I loved it. Said it was better then the can.
e3a45a4c-8661-409f-b1c0-5a6fa43f39ce;krisnavarra;5;Very good. Did not have any green peppers so I used mini yellow peppers which worked well. Plan to eat it with baked fish.
e3a45a4c-8661-409f-b1c0-5a6fa43f39ce;maryficokromer;5;I had an abundance of tomatoes this growing season. I added 2 fresh jalapeños, fresh basil and garlic. My husband loved it. Will definitely make it again
e3a45a4c-8661-409f-b1c0-5a6fa43f39ce;cr42cr42;5;At start of cooking. Used yellow peppers since I did not have green, very colorful. Finished product was YUM!
e3a45a4c-8661-409f-b1c0-5a6fa43f39ce;billappleton;5;Great dish with a twist, never have I put celery in my stewed tomatoes. I would now recommend cooking the veggies in 3 stages, first cook the celery because it takes much longer to soften then the bell pepper and onions and last the tomatoes. By the time my celery was done the tomatoes had lost their shape and texture. I also doubled the oregano and used a 1/4 cup fresh basil.
e3a45a4c-8661-409f-b1c0-5a6fa43f39ce;judy;5;This is a great recipe to use up the tomatoes in your garden at the end of the season. I'm glad I found it. I did make my own changes once the I finished up the stewed tomatoes and after tasting it I will give this recipe 5 stars. I wanted more of sauce/gravy for pasta. I added 1 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes. I also had 1/2 jar of store bought marinara sauce in the frig so I also added this along with 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese. Delicious!
e3a45a4c-8661-409f-b1c0-5a6fa43f39ce;stephaniecustozzobarkay;5;I made this recipe because we are overwhelmed with tomatoes right now. I intended to freeze the stewed tomatoes. Unfortunately, I ate it ALL. It is good warm or cold. I dipped chips into it. Very good. This recipe is a keeper!. I did add more sugar because I like it sweet.
e3a45a4c-8661-409f-b1c0-5a6fa43f39ce;vickigarrettgood;5;Very easy and good. Just what I was looking for in a stewed tomato recipe.
e3a45a4c-8661-409f-b1c0-5a6fa43f39ce;brewcrew;4;No changes, fresh tomatoes and peppers from our garden. Used to make Okra and Tomato Skillet, and Tomato Bacon Gravy from this site. I recommend both of those recipes, too.
e3a45a4c-8661-409f-b1c0-5a6fa43f39ce;thomasacorveddu;5;Absolutely delicious! I made these tonight and they were a hit with my family! I did not have celery, so I substituted zucchini instead. I did not have cornstarch, so I used flour instead. I will definitely make these again. Stewed tomatoes have always been a comfort food for me. Now I have this awesome recipe! Thank you!
e3a45a4c-8661-409f-b1c0-5a6fa43f39ce;tom;4;I did add a bit more oregano and basil then called for, kept everything else the same. Very nice addition to a meal as a side dish or add to fish.
e3a45a4c-8661-409f-b1c0-5a6fa43f39ce;sue;5;I made this recipe to use up an abundance of tomatoes from my garden. My husband doesn’t like onion or celery in it, so I left it out. I did cook the peppers for a while before adding the tomatoes to soften them up a little quicker. After it was done and tasting it, I added a little extra dried basil, and oregano to enhance the tase a little more since I didn’t use onion or celery. We loved it. Made another batch and froze it. Will definitely keep this recipe for next year.
e3a45a4c-8661-409f-b1c0-5a6fa43f39ce;mariaplancarteumaa;5;This was delicious, we ate it as a soup base and then added a can of tomato sauce and kidney beans and made it into chili. Very flavorful excellent as a base or by itself. Was a big hit for entire family.
e3a45a4c-8661-409f-b1c0-5a6fa43f39ce;tina;5;Turned out great! I actually added a can of 'Manwich' which added a nice spice (or as I like to call it, 'zing'). A pinch of dried red pepper and chili powder. Then I added some cooked shells to wrap it all up. Good stuff!!!
e3a45a4c-8661-409f-b1c0-5a6fa43f39ce;lesliemurin;5;Just what I wanted. Next time I'll soften the vegs before the tomatoes go in the pan but otherwise perfect
e3a45a4c-8661-409f-b1c0-5a6fa43f39ce;missy;4;Use stewed tomatoes cold to top off a bowl of mac and cheese. This works great.
e3a45a4c-8661-409f-b1c0-5a6fa43f39ce;chefal;5;I was looking for something different to use up all the tomatoes and peppers at our home. This was a simple, tasty dish that my family enjoyed. I added diced zucchini and chopped flat leaf parsley. It was nice as a hot dish, but even better after it had time to cool down and allow the flavour to develop.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;almab;4;Great recipe to build off of. I added garlic powder to give it a little more depth.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;parentfamilymail;5;The best salsa I've ever had can't wait to try it with a tomatillo in it!!!!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;stevebrandon;5;Easy to make salsa with great taste!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;valtinsley;4;Great and easy recipe! Next time I will put half an onion instead of a whole onion.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;brandipayne;5;I had homegrown tomatoes and leftover cilantro so this was easy to make. I added jalapeño powder for an extra kick.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;markjohnson;4;I used 4 large tomatoes = 5 cups diced... This turned out really delicious, I may try a little more lime, maybe a tsp.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;hollydailey;5;Came out deliciously fresh! Followed recipe as written, a little less jalapeño as our daughter likes things mild. Definitely making this again!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;superbaker123;4;This is a very good recipe, and the salsa came out great, but you need to finely dice the tomatoes and the onions. If you chop them like the recipe says, you'll be left with large pieces rather than a salsa. After making the it, I ran the salsa through a small food processor and it was an easy fix.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;jes;5;It a great simple yet tasty salsa. So easy to make!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;bman39;4;Great recipe. Only additions were using the juice of half a lime, salt.pulse 1/2 tsp. of adobo seasoning and cumin. I used a food processor and chopped up everything except the tomatoes first. Peeled the tomatoes from our garden which were really sweet and balanced the heat from using a large jalapeno pepper. Going to eat with fajitas and with the some small tortilla scoop bowls.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;zoeewalters;5;Great recipe! I cut and added cubes ham to mine and it give gave it a little extra. I wouldn’t mind trying bacon in it too.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;gavthecat;5;I made this to go with diner, and I am a pre-teen so it is very easy to make. I would suggest making it.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;kellyskitchenrecipes;5;This is delicious and so tasty! A big hit at my parties.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;aliciadodsonlooper;4;This was very good. I added Apple cider vinegar and it added just the tang that it needed.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;seth;3;I added pepper and tobacco
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;lindaloy;5;this is a very flavorful and satisfying salsa - so easy to make!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;jbgoode;5;SIMPLE, easy throw -together recipe. Must sit though to truly appreciate flavors. Easy to adjust individual ingredients depending on tastes.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;margierobinson;3;Definitely more of a pico than a salsa. It was missing something though.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;dawsonepp;5;Great Salsa, made my relatives sweat haha
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;rebeccamischel;5;A solid salsa recipe that can be tweaked depending on how spicy you want it. I cooked mine for about 10 minutes just to soften the onions, before I sealed them in a jar. Tastes even better after sitting in the jar for a few days.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;mary;5;Delish! Very fresh and healthy.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;jenngg;5;I used a variety of fresh tomatoes, roasted the jalapeño and BOOM! Love this recipe.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;melodymalone;5;I am go to make salsa tomorrow night.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;bron77;5;Got lots of compliments on this when I made it for a party. Tastes great - and as others have said even better if it sits overnight.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;jamesdeborde;4;This is a decent recipe for salsa and easy to put together , I would serve it to friends .
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;angelahughes;5;Delicious! I played around with the salt & lime, also added some more cilantro. Would definitely make this again.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;kitchenninja;5;I made the mistake of judging by the picture. The salsa ingredients are spot on with the exception of needing tomato sauce. Once tomato sauce was added .org a bit of extra lime juice.... perfection. Great starter recipe for salsa then the cook can cater to specific taste. Just like the description says. Great!!!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;katherine;5;"My mother said it was ""The best salsa I've ever had."" and the rest of my family agreed it was really good. I will be making this again soon, It is very good. You wont regret making this!"
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;englishell;5;So delicious that II could drink this! I did not have a tomatillo, so left this out. Because of digestive issues, I used minced dried onions instead of fresh onions. Must try with tomatillo next time.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;davidg07;2;This was easy to make, but just kind of bland. Most native Texans would agree this needs more flavor, and even with all of the jalapeño added it isn’t spicy.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;estheranddiarra;5;We loved it sister keep it up, praise Jesus and say your prayers. Amen.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;angela;5;I will never buy salsa again. Delicious! We added extra lime as we do to everything. My husband suggested we try adding green chili’s, a bell pepper or other peppers for fun to change it up once in a while. This is perfect, though. I will make bigger batches to freeze at some point too. Thank you!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;sharonthomas;5;My 10 year old granddaughter made this and we love it.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;nishikakariuki;5;This was my first time making salsa and it was so easy, simple and delicious!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;adris;4;I prefer a hotter salsa, so added 3 jalepenos, and some jalapeno powder. I also lightly blistered the veggies and added a little wine vinegar to the mix before putting into the food processor. Nice base, but required a few modifications for our specific tastes.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;aya;5;Made as written it's 4 stars but I TRIPLED the garlic and it's wonderful !
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;klo09;5;My first time doing salsa. It tasted really good, but I may of added too much onion, it was very oniony. Also threw the ingredients into the food processor, the flavour was there but the presentation wasn’t.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;courtneyware;5;Made this and guacamole and my family loved it.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;unity;5;The fresher the onion and cilantro the better you can taste them in the salsa.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;adventurouspalate;4;This is a very nice, easy to make, fresh salsa. I read the reviews after I actually made it and saw the recommendations to cut down on the amount of onion. I agree. I will probably use a small onion or half a large onion next time. Didn’t have a tomatillo either so made it without and it was fine.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;jessicaashurst;4;It’s a good guide for ingredients, but the recipe as written isn’t very specific about the amount of onion used. Onions’ size greatly affect the taste
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;annio;2;This really is Pico de Gallo. It’s ok, just very bland. There is way to much cillentro for our liking. . I added lots of seasoning and used on tacos.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;joelwatkins;5;Loved it. I used Santa Fe Grande peppers instead of Jalapeno's. I gave a jar to someone who is a good friend of mine and neighbor, they liked it so much they offered to pay me if I made them a few jars more.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;jacjac;4;All ingredients (except lime juice) came from my own garden which made it extra special. Family picked crops, I mixed salsa. Real tasty dish too.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;sweetteanc;5;Remove the tomato seeds before blending with the other ingredients. Delicious!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;chellyrash;5;Very good salsa recipe! My family likes real hit so we adjusted it with more jalapenos and garlic.... Came out great! So easy to make and nice to know it's fresh made!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;lisajones;4;Great salsa! I made as is. Thanks!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;sailenns;4;I made this without cilantro and could not find a tomatillo, but I added half a can of sweet corn and it worked nicely.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;barrywatson;4;First time making slasa. I used pretty much what I had on hand. I used some cilantro and a jalapeno from my garden and the rest I had on hand except for the lime and tomatillo. I used 3 medium sized tomatoes. I blended two of them and chopped the other. I blended the tomatillo and garlic together and squeezed half a lime into the bowl. I also added 2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar. 3/4 of a large onion. Not as much cilantro as I would like. 1 whole jalapeno, but it was on the small side. Just the right amount of heat for me! Love this!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;sherry;5;Great salsa. Could not stop eating this!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;lauraswanson;4;This is a bit more like pico de gallo rather than the traditional saucier salsa, but it's a good starting point. For us, it was not spicy enough (but then I'm a habanero girl myself), so we will definitely add more peppers next time. But, if you like a milder flavor, this will be perfect for you.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;randallflanagan;5;Very good salsa. I put in half a jalapeño. We love mild salsa and this is one of the best.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;barbarainclenrock;5;I love this simple Salsa. The only change I made and it's strictly a personal taste is, I peeled the tomatoes and squeezed them in to pieces. Learned this from my daughters Guatemalan housekeeper and did not use a tomatillo. I also seed the jalapeño. I like my salsa mild.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;jeffbodart;2;It came out very bland.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;robdreher;5;This Salsa is without any doubt one of my favorites especially with garden fresh ripe tomatoes & Jalapenos. We do leave out the Bell Pepper.... Thanks for sharing it with me!!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;scout05;5;Very tasty... too mild for my family - doubled the jalapeno and threw in a serrano and a dash of siracha, and it was perfect. Used the little kitchenaid mini-food processor, just pulsed a few times to get a good consistency. (Note - the jalapenos and the serrano were home grown and seemed very mild anyway, my changes did not make it super spicy, just enough heat. :) ) Added probably a bit more garlic than it called for and used a sweet vidalia onion, to offset the extra heat I threw in. It came out super tasty! Do not skip the lime either.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;cheryl;5;I make this recipe ALL the time just as it is. I do put it in the food processor at varying degrees of puree. Makes it easier to scoop up on a chip. Just remember the salsa will only be as flavorful as your vegetables. The fresher the better.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;tiariapikesovalle;5;I made this is turn out great!!! Just less garlic and a half of onion. With these minor adjustments it has been a hit!!!!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;alexandria626;4;Added 1/4 teaspoon cumin, 1 packet of stevia and I substituted cilantro for curled parsley. I was out of cilantro and it is a great substitution. This was delicious with the additional ingredients!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;darrell;4;Followed recipe except for jalapenos...loved it!!!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;shadwilloughby;3;I added Cumin.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;vivian;4;We like our salsa with some kick so added some red pepper flakes and ground cayenne pepper. Will keep in the fridge just drain off some of the juice before serving.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;logan;3;Its not bad, but its definitly lacking somthing.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;joe;5;I've made this several times and each has turned out constantly well. I just swapped out the cilantro with basil and still as good as ever.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;mayabanda;5;I absolutely loved this recipe! It was very easy to make and my guests loved it. I would definitely make this again for any party that i will be throwing
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;hollyjenae;1;This salsa recipe came out weird for us.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;jonthorpe;3;I added in one-quarter teaspoon of coriander and used one habanero instead of a jalepeno. Excellent recipe!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;meanwhileincrete;5;I didn't have a tomatillo but I added some cucumber instead and it's a lovely fresh salsa
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;lisa;4;Flavorful. It is waiting in the fridge for tonight (New Years Eve) and hoping that the flavors meld together after the rest. It was a lot of chopping as I made a double batch!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;jadekauffman;5;I had to come back here and find this so I could rave. I made several batches of this salsa at once and hot bath canned it. I took out the salt and replaced it with a tablespoon of vinegar for each recipe since I have found that the vinegar tames the peppers some and I don't like it when my food hurts. I canned this in pints and half pints and I've been doling it out here and there to friends. Last night I realized that I'm going to the Farmer's Market next week and last year's canning has to be consumed. Imagine my delight when I found four half pints of my favorite salsa, tucked away behind the potatoes, spaghetti sauce and carrots from last year. These four are mine, and I couldn't be happier. Generosity is all well and good, but this salsa should stay home, too. This year, I'll do two big batches. One to gift and one for me! Excellent recipe!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;wjwr;4;"This was delicious! I took the advice of the author and only added 1/2 of the jalapeño and it was plenty spicy for my northerner tongue! I used Ohio homegrown tomatoes which added a sweetness. I also followed other reviewers recommendations by not adding as much onion (used a little more than 1/2 cup chopped) or garlic (used 2 cloves). I pureed in a blender 1/2 of the mixture to give it more of a restaurant-salsa consistency but it was very liquidy and a little frothy so next time I might not do that. I had to put away the chips to stop from eating the whole recipe! ;)"
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;keenan3157;5;"This is a delicious and fast treat for an appetizer, a party or anytime. It only took about fifteen minutes to make and the flavor is really excellent. I had 8-9 garden tomatoes left after giving some to family and friends and IDK what to do with them. I didn't have enough to make sauce but my wife suggested we try to make some salsa. I thought that was a great idea; plus it was my birthday the next day and we were having some family home for dinner and cake. So we made the salsa and everyone really loved it. I did everything just like the recipe said and it came out perfectly. I have to admit that it sort of bugs me when ppl give a recipe one star and then go on to explain that they didn't have half of the ingredients and they substituted the other half. So we did it exactly as it was written and we all thought it was great. Much much better than jar salsa. Even better than take-out salsa from the fresh section of Whole Foods. IDK how long it keeps in the fridge because we ate it all! It was a great use of our homegrown Jersey tomatoes and a new favorite for my family."
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;nrbt;5;"Delicious! I'm allergic to onion, so I don't really get to enjoy jarred or restaurant salsa. I've always known it was ""easy"" to make but I'm not much of a cook, so I hadn't gotten around to giving it a try, until this past week I discovered that the last onion-free salsa had been reformulated and was now out of bounds for me. For this recipe, I simply left out the onion and kind of eyeballed everything else, then pulsed it a couple of times in the blender. Both my husband and I loved it, and I can only imagine it will be even better tomorrow once it's melded more."
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;wedge;3;Far too much cilantro for my taste. I would start with half the called for amount and work from there.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;temporarilymary;4;"This was too bland for our taste, so after sampling the recipe as written, I added a second jalapeño. It's better now, but I would probably start with two peppers and adjust upward. My son never needed a recipe to make this; I have to refer to recipes to be sure I haven't left out anything. LOL"
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;amy;5;Easy Peasy! Added avocado and shuck n jive
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;aliseb;3;Very tomato-y! Seemed to lack some spice, but can't really say what. Nice basic salsa.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;mzkg;4;worked out nicely.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;zoe;4;Add this to chunky spicy salsa. Very good.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;genevievejulian;5;Very tasty! I used a can of hot, chopped jalapeno since it was all I had. It was a bit too hot so I cut it with some sour cream. FANTASTIC!! Still spicy, great flavor! Love the fresh taste! So simple to make. Even my kids loved it. Has plenty of room for experimenting if wanted but not necessary. Good post!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;quinlantyree;5;I loved this salsa, and it is now my got to recipe! It's nice to just to have in the fridge for a snack.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;westsluvfood;3;Average fresh salsa. Way too much onion. I recommend 1/2 an onion.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;lindseycorwin;3;Instead of Adding the cilantro I added green peppers.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;holly;3;"It was ""ok"" I felt like it needed ALOT of salt to taste like anything."
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;tonya;5;I love this recipe! Nothing added to the ingredient list (mine too is more like pico de gallo). I am always disappointed with the lack of flavor of most salsas. This recipe has all the flavor! I would say it takes a little longer to prepare than 10 min, but it is soooo worth it. Thanks Cecilia!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;kalden;5;This is my first time making homemade salsa and it's perfect! I was Abel
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;klynnm333;4;My sister said that this salsa was similar to what she had in CA. I enjoyed it and it gets better as it chills.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;peggynichols;5;This salsa is awesome...Had friends over everyone loved it!!!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;jeannebracken;4;This is a really good, easy to make recipe. I made a few modifications based on the other reviews. I used 1/2 of a vidalia onion (diced that in a mini food chopper/processor), added 1/2 tsp cumin, instead of only using large tomatoes, we cut up a variety of tomatoes (by hand, not a food processor as we wanted chunky) - cherry/grape tomatoes, roma and a beefsteak so that there was a variety of flavors - total of 3 cups. We threw in 2 jalapenos (used the mini food chopper/processor). At 1st it was on the spicy side so threw in a little bit of sugar to cut the heat. RAVE reviews from the party we went to. THANK YOU for posting!!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;koffegirl;5;The first time I made this I put everything in a food processor, big mistake! The onion juices overpowered everything else. I had to through it out. Second time I didn't and it was delicious. Just to be safe I only used half an onion. I also doubled the lime juice. Will make again.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;iloveyum;5;It was an amazing appetizer, especially with homemade chips! We did not have jalapeño's so we used seasoning
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;ginnyzerger;5;I am not a chef or very good cook, but my husband raved about this, and I LOVED it too. So fresh and delicious! I am making it tonight for the second time in less than a week (but doubling it!). I did add the whole jalapeno.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;youngjennifer;5;This is pretty much the way I have made salsa for years. I never really measure anything, but everything looks about what I do except maybe I add more cilantro. I do add about 1 t. of cumin for some pep. I also seed my jalapenos, spray them with Pam, and then broil them until the skin turns black before using them- it gives them a smoky flavor. I vary the amount of jalapeno depending on the crowd. To make this super easy, I do everything in my food processor. I start with the items that I want more finely diced: start with jalapenos and garlic, pulse it til small, then add everything else but tomatoes. I pulse again until well chopped and blended. I add tomatoes last and only pulse til they are roughly chopped.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;keeper;5;Very good , just like Mexico
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;dbenoit5055;4;This was very good! I added a little corn and black bean to this salsa. Other than that, made as it. Everyone liked it. Thanks!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;jess;5;Great as is...or good base to change it up! I added about 1.5 cups chopped mango (frozen, slightly defrosted). I made it all in a food processor. Turned out so good with the mango!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;jakiirsms;3;For more punch add one envelope of Lawrys Taco Seasoning Mix and lower the amount of cilantro. It is a very powerful seasoning and a little goes a long way.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;chadro;3;Everyone likes a different heat in their salsa. It all goes with a person's personal preference. Myself, I thought it was way too bland and should be called more of a Pico. For this size I tripled the Jalapenos, added a couple milder red cherry peppers, about a teaspoon of cumin, and half a teaspoon or so of chili powder. This is a good recipe for a base or for those with mild taste buds.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;omnomnom;2;We followed the recipe but it ended up tasting bad. It tasted too sour for me and a little too much like just raw tomato. Not sure what I did wrong.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;pielover;5;Great recipe.. Thanx! Used fresh squeezed lime juice instead.. Goes great with spicy Doritos.. Ready for Bears football game.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;thereagors1;4;This is a good recipe ,I used green pepper instead of onion and it was so good we were eating it before we let it set in the fridge for the next day.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;corysgal;5;Great fresh salsa! I omitted the garlic, used about 1/2 white onion and added cumin powder to taste (probably about 1/2 teaspoon). I also used canned jalapeno, because that was all I had. Thanks!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;tim;5;I just made this for the first time last weekend and it was GREAT! I doubled the garlic and added a little more lime juice and salt. My family couldn't get enough of it.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;sellison;5;I was looking for something to do with some tomatoes and jalapenos from our garden. This recipe hit the spot. I'm pretty sure I doubled the tomato and after reading other reviews, I'm glad I did, to keep the onion flavor down. I mixed it in the blender and hubby loved it.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;jamieb;5;Everyone loved this! Would make it again
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;krisd;4;Pretty good basic recipe!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;lauraelie;4;Very good and a little hot
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;moodfood;4;Great recipe for quick, simple salsa. I found it tasted WAY better 2 days after making it. I also found you need to add quite a bit of salt to bring out the flavor. 1/2 a jalapeno will make it very mild, even my 2 year old could eat it. In a covered stainless bowl in the fridge it kept for a week and tasted great.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;davidlewis;5;Ingredient wise this pretty much matches a recipe I have been using for a while and it always works as long as I TASTE it while in the process. I've noted a few complaints and I think tasting it while in process is the key. Some tomatoes are sweeter and some are more sour, some jalapenos have more heat than others, and some onions vary is sweetness and strength. You have to taste and make adjustments because of these variances. You can also make it with canned tomatoes for more of a Mexican restaurant consistency.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;ashleyfuhrman;4;I added an extra jalapeno (and all the seeds), two extra tomatillas, two serrano peppers, cumin, chili powder and a can of tomato paste. I omitted the lime juice and reduced the cilantro. I pulsed everything in a food processor and then strained off the excess liquid.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;melissamariebelanger;5;OMG this was the best homemade salsa I have ever tasted!! I loved how garden fresh i was and the spice was perfect(even tho I added an extra pepper)
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;annecassens;5;Updated 7/24/17: Made this again today - very flexible with however much of each ingredient you have on hand. Added tomato paste (1-6 T. as you like) so the juices don't get wasted. I only had 1 jalapeño, so I added a teaspoon of my favorite hot sauce - Isabel Street Heat Chipotle. A big hit! www.isabelstreetheat.com
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;jessica;4;Excellent recipe! So easy and very tasty. I don't like spice so omitted the jalapeno. And did not use 1/2 cup cilantro. Will make this again and again!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;donnawarrick;3;It's hard to determine what is a large tomato or onion, and is the cilantro packed or loose? I ended up with an overwhelming cilantro flavor for the 4 cups of chopped tomatoes that I used. The flavor was good, just too much. I have to tweek this quite a bit to get it right.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;stopmakingwebsitesthatsuck;5;This salsa is healthy, very low calorie, easily adjusted to personal tastes, ready quickly, and tastes great. I've made mine without onions because of a food allergy as well as varied the garlic and salt. Tomatillo and jalepeño are musts for authentic taste. Yellow or blue corn chips complement well.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;rudenun;4;Great salsa! I added one serrano pepper to the mix and the salsa had a very slight bite to it. I may add another on the next round. I also used green onions instead of the regular onion.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;alexrose718;5;The BEST salsa I've ever had! :) Well done!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;josephnewberry;5;I love the flavor so, I love the recipe with the tomatillo. I skipped the salt only because I forgot to add and used a blender cause I like mine a bit more fluid versus chunky. But HELP! What am I doing wrong? Why doesn't the salsa color come out as bright red? My batch came out a muddy color.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;hollydaze;2;Way too much onion.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;kelly;5;Excellent recipe! I made this because I didn't realize that I ran out of salsa. I'll never buy salsa ever again. Freshly made is SO MUCH BETTER!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;abishop;5;Delicious! I love chunky salsa so this recipe was perfect! Farm bought tomatoes gave it a fresh, homemade taste. Cut back on the jalepenos if you want it more on the mild side.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;jmmr1969;5;Great! A couple very minor tweaks that I made...I put 2 tomatoes into the food processor and diced the other 2, to have a salsa-like consistency. Included with the tomatoes in the processor, I added the jalapeno. I reduced the onion to half and reduced the cilantro a little - you can always add more later if you prefer more. I increased the lime juice to 1 whole lime (2 TBSP??). Added one can of diced green chilies. I didn't measure the salt (wish I did), but it takes quite a bit to get the right profile. It is one of the best salsa's that I have ever had anywhere. The only thing that would make it better is if I had garden-fresh tomatoes:(
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;margaret;5;It's really a great & easy one! I do not have jalapeno pepper, I used tabasco for substitue, and is still great taste, me and my hobby like very much. will make again definitely.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;lindseyjoyburkey;5;This is so great. I followed the recipe exactly (which is rare for me!) and ended up with a super tasty pico de gallo (I'm not sure that I would really call it salsa, but that's no problem as far a I'm concerned). I used a whole small jalapeno and I didn't think it was too spicy. I'm usually a mild to medium salsa lover and this had just a bit of kick but not too much at all. One thing to mention: my husband and I can definitely hold our own when it comes to eating, and we had *a ton* of this left over. It was no problem for us, I put the leftovers in with a can of storebought pasta sauce and it was a delicious way to take the jarred sauce up a notch! Great recipe - I'll be making this again soon.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;ernestdc;5;"Very easy to make. For that more resturant look I used a food processor with a little chicken broth. Also I used ""chile de monte"" or chile piquien instead of jalapeno. This is a small round chile found in most mexican food markets. It grows wild here. Also very easy to grow. Spicey but very smooth. it is small so I ground before I added seeds and all."
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;deejaykelsey;5;this is the bomb..... i added a habenero to the mix and added a little more lime juice . it was fabuloso....
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;cookandahalf;5;Very good salsa. We don't care for garlic all that much, so I cut that back a bit. I have also found that you can chop up some of the green tomatoes and add it gives the salsa brighter taste to it, and it also gives it nice salsa with a bit of different texture. Very good the way it is. Also added more jalapeno to make it have a little more heat
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;whitesnowbunny;5;Really good. I didn't use all of the 1/2 cup of celrtantro. I did add some of my fresh peppers and cayenne pepper to taste. Came out perfect! Next time I would love to add some papaya!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;cherylmarie;5;This is an excellent salsa recipe. If you put it in the food processor, chop the onion by hand to avoid having it taste too onion-y from all of the juices. Also, one jalepeno is just not enough. It was less than mild. Last time I made it I used 3! Also, leaving it to sit in the fridge overnight really does let the flavors settle. The jalepeno gets milder from the tomatoes. I think that is why I needed so many to taste the kick!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;madchef;1;The onion ans cilantro are far too pungent in this recipe. I ended up adding allot more tomato to balance it out.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;jackie;1;We did not like this at all. I followed recipe exactly and it just didn't taste good at all.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;wendilou02;5;Quick, Easy, YUMMY! I added just a little less lime juice so it wasn't so tangy, but it is a great recipe!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;blueeye1031;2;This was not the best, I will keep looking for a salsa recipe. I ended up cooking the salsa till it became thick, added corn and black beans and hot sauce. Maybe my hot pepper wasn't ripe enough because before I altered the recipe the salsa really had no spice at all.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;pokeyscupcake;4;pretty good, felt like it was missing something so i added a little bit of sugar.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;toocute7387;5;SO tasty!!!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;minka1340;5;This was a very delicious recipe! :) We are definitely making this again.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;rexhutcheson;4;6-9-11: Pretty good.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;jenalin;5;Added some cumin & this was a major hit!!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;adelyne;4;Amazing!!! No more store bought salsa for us!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;maggiecp;5;this is definitely your basic fresh pico de gallo recipe. Saying that, I loved it! I added an extra jalapeño to give it even more heat, and I used my food processor to get a smooth/chunky texture. I do think this makes more than just 4 servings though....I have tons leftover (not that I'm complaining!)
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;laine;5;I love this salsa! I used 1/2 tsp. of salt.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;wilmany64;5;Recipe was good and easy to make. I added it to my box. Ty!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;karen;3;It seemed like it was missing some depth in flavor. I tried adding some more spices like oregano and garlic powder but I felt like it needed something else. Not sure what.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;smosieur;5;I didn't realize how simple it is to make salsa! I followed the recipe exactly (with the exception of the tomatillo because I didn't have one). It is so good! Even before I gave the ingredients a chance to marry. I'll never buy jar salsa again!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;julirob;5;I love this salsa recipe, and I have tried many being from the Southwest. I usually add an extra jalepeno because we like ours hot, and I use the McCormick sea salt and garlic grinder for extra flavor. Always a hit!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;brentaguero;5;This was just the recipe I was looking for. I did cut back on the onion and added an extra jalapeno. Very good!!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;sarahcastro;4;Delicious and easy recipe. I used half an onion (as others recommended in the reviews), and my husband didn't think it was spicy enough. I did chop all the ingredients by hand, which was time-consuming, but worth it in the end. It kept it from getting too soupy. Will make again with more heat. Thanks for the recipe!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;foodaholic123;5;great recipe!!!we had WAYYY to many tomatoes from our garden,but not anymore!!!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;bakermd;3;Agree with the majority of reviews that onion is WAY overpowering. I ended up adding about 6 more tomatoes just to balance it out! It's definitely missing something...salt maybe, but overall OK.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;nicole326;4;I think this salsa was pretty good overall. I blended everything in a food processor to give it a finer texture (I'm not into big chunks of tomato and onion!). It wasn't really spicy at all and the tomato flavor was a little overpowering, but all minor adjustments.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;missb;4;Great recipe! I threw all the ingredients in a food processor and it turned out great!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;suzieq;4;I was really craving salsa so I thought I'd try this since it looked pretty easy and delicious. I agree with others it was more pico de gallo than salsa. I cut way back on the cilantro but it still was too strong for my personal preference. I added an extra jalapeno but I still thought it was too mild. I enjoyed this but will make some changes next time. Thanks for sharing
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;jennifer;5;Thought this turned out excellently! i added a tiny sprinkle of cumin in as well, and seemed to give the salsa an extra little kick. im letting it sit in the refrigerator a bit before serving, hopefully the flavors will meld and it will get even better! thanks for the recipe!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;judithann;4;"This is a good basic salsa recipe. I did, however, cut WAY down on the onion as other reviewers suggested (as written, it overpowered the taste of the tomatoes and cilantro flavor and didn't even taste like ""salsa""). I only used 3 tablespoons of very finely diced sweet onion. I also substituted a 1/2 can of diced green chiles as I didn't have any fresh on hand. This is a quick salsa to make and can be easily modified to individual taste. Thanks Cecilia!"
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;majykman;5;This was delicious.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;threecatsmom;3;"This was actually more of a pico de gallo. It tasted very fresh, but was missing that ""kick."" All in all, however, a fresh, yummy dip!"

5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;janeth;4;This was fun for my kids to prepare in the food processor. Just a few pulses and we had delicious homemade salsa. This taste so much better than the store bought brands.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;kelyfran;5;delicious! I make this all the time!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;gemini1412;4;I love this recipe. I sometimes remove about a third, food process, and mix it back in. Better on day 2.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;scatrow;4;Very good starter recipe. I made it, ate it then gave the rest away so I could make more & customize it to my liking better. I recommend doing the same. For me, too much onion, not enough garlic. I didnt use the tomatillo (honestly cuz Im not sure what it is!) But it was wonderful because everything was done with fresh garden produce. Making it again tonight.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;triciadouglasfisher;5;Delicious! I thought it turned out very well and a very good balance of flavors. It makes a nice big batch and also great consistency!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;sharondunkerson;5;Fantastic! My husband and I cannot eat cilantro so threw in some fresh sweet basil instead. I served it on Sunday when my son and his fiance were over and everyone agreed it was much better than any store bought they'd ever had!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;julhodgden;4;I took it to a mexican dinner and it was hit. I cut the amount of onion to about half and the garlic to only two cloves. I didn't have any jalapeno peppers so I made a mild with no peppers and a extra hot with habaneros. I used the food processor after adding everything but the peppers I took half of the salsa out for the mild and added some habaneros, processed it and I had my extra hot salsa.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;melissab;5;I really enjoyed this salsa. And even though I had to make it with dried cilantro, it still came out great! I look forward to making it again with fresh cilantro.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;sherbie29;4;pretty good! I make this version for myself and then a version with three minced serrano peppers for my husband who prefers hot salsa.

5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;chicosgirl;5;This salsa was awesome! I like it hot so I added 2 jalapenos instead and it was delish!!!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;tompetersen;5;We make this salsa every couple of months or when we find Roma tomatoes on sale. Our family loves it. Our daughter takes it to school to share with her friends! Great recipe!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;katyrobb;2;This recipe calls for way too much onion. We added 2 extra tomatoes, more lime juice, black beans and corn and it still had an aftertaste of pungent onions. If I make this recipe again we'll cut the onion in half.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;kimberleerandall;4;Remember not very many jalapenos!!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;jpecoraro;5;great recipe, i wanted it hot so i made it with 3 serranos and two habeneros. i got my wish.
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;dranoel;4;I'd say that this is really pico de gallo. But, we really like it with taco chips... low-cal & tasty snack!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;xoorgullosaox;4;I went to a party last week and a friend of mine brought a dip similar to this one, and after trying it I had to make it. I came here and found this recipe. It has been a week and I've made this dip twice! I must admit that they weren't the same recipe, this one is actually better! The garlic and jalapenos give it quite the kick, and my family is in love with Cilantro, so this is the perfect recipe!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;dibenson;5;Just what I was looking for. Thank you!
5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;jamierigsby;5;"Good, basic salsa recipe. Actually, more like pico de gallo than salsa, but you could always put in food processor. We like this recipe just the way it is - it is chunky and full of flavor.

5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;angyl;3;This salsa is mostly onion, and very strongly so. The cilantro is very strong, too. It would be better if these two ingredients were reduced by about half, and maybe more tomatoes used.

5c5372a5-baf7-4fd1-97a4-ea6df6018bb6;jenn;5;This is the quintissential salsa recipe. The cool tomatoes contrast nicely against the spicy jalapenos and pungent onion, and the lime juice and salt round out the flavors nicely. Let it sit overnight to really let the flavor develop.
5e822998-330e-4167-b352-1f7ac8bdc957;maryvinci;4;Very good. Maybe a little dry could add a little broth to soften them 😉
5e822998-330e-4167-b352-1f7ac8bdc957;minay;5;This is an excellent recipe. Super simple to make and extremely healthy (but doesn't taste like it!), this will be my go-to from now on. Watch out for MY mistakes- I didn't use small enough potatoes, you have to really go for the baby size to cook perfectly in the time stated and be sure you are using a medium high heat on your stove so you won't have burning (or, even worse, no crunch). I mixed my spices together and then sprinkled them evenly over the potatoes, which I think worked far better for evening out the taste, and I added a little more oil plus some Cajun seasoning on my second preparation. This was strictly to my taste, the recipe truly is perfect.
5e822998-330e-4167-b352-1f7ac8bdc957;pecanpie;5;Great!! Didn’t have parsley so put some Parmesan cheese in there when I fried them.

5e822998-330e-4167-b352-1f7ac8bdc957;plates4u;5;Good recipe steam then lightly fry. I added a bit of minced garlic instead and fresh Italian parsley. Kosher salt or coarse salt also worked well with this potatoes. Cubed Yukon Gold potatoes would be an option just in case you do not have baby potatoes. I would say use 2 tbsps of olive oil but still adjust it to the amount of the potatoes. Only add the oil if you see it needs a bit more crisping or browning.

ceaf3cb7-d987-42f2-bdf9-5f849d1ac861;peterpentz;5;Excellent recipe. Tip: if you need it same day, fry the fish 2 minutes each side, set aside and pour the curry/pickle sauce* in the pan and bring to a light simmer and place the fish back in, spooning sauce over the fish. Let it all low poach for 5 minutes. * a dash or two of Peri Peri or Tabasco sauce works well if you don't have a red chile pepper.

ceaf3cb7-d987-42f2-bdf9-5f849d1ac861;amandar;4;My husband is from Cape Town and loves pickled fish! Perfect lunch with bread and green salad. I've made this 2x -- first time exactly as written and 2nd time with a few changes. It seems to me that in the Cape, pickled fish is lightly battered and fried. I wanted to cut down on the oil and fat so rather than frying the fish, I grilled it under the broiler until just cooked. I like the sauce as written, except I agree that the vinegar was a bit much. I used 1 1/2 cups and thought that was still a bit strong. I think I should have upped the brown sugar a bit to balance the flavor.
ceaf3cb7-d987-42f2-bdf9-5f849d1ac861;brookelaurel;4;"I really loved this recipe! I only made a couple of changes; added few extra bay leaves (dried), extra peppercorns and added a teaspoon of fennel seeds in place of the coriander. I changed the proportion of vinegar:sugar a little, cutting back on the vinegar - and thought it was a little too sweet at first, but found that the vinegar seemed more pronounced the next day. A friend made the same recipe & put in the whole amount of vinegar, finding it a little too acidic, so it might be an idea to just add 1 & 1/2 cups. On a whole, there was so much flavour in this! All you need is soft bread to soak up the marinade - it's so good."

The end result seemed more trouble than it was worth to me. I would call it a two, but my guy liked it a lot (maybe because he didn’t fry it?) so I averaged to three stars.

We here all of our own food, including sugar, flour and meal. And these, the fried green tomatoes, never had corn meal in them. Try them the way we had them also. You could like one better than the other. Put them in a egg dip, and dredge them in flour. Spring with salt and pepper. So good. Pulls the natural tanginess and tart from the tomatoes. Fry until golden or for a healthier version, start in frying pan, and bake to finish. Good either way

52e17064-14d9-42d0-a7d2-ade94ac19131;traceyferrariposner;5;Fantastic recipe although I didn't use any cornmeal, instead, I used Panko crumbs. I find that the cornmeal gives it a heavier taste and holds more oil than panko crumbs do. I also gave them a quick spin in the blender to make them a bit finer. It worked like a charm. I added some cayenne pepper to the flour and left the salt out until the minute I took them out of the pan. I placed them on a rack on a rimmed baking sheet so that the air could circulate around them and put them into a preheated oven of 275F while I cooked off the rest of them. WOW! They are AMAZING and were perfectly browned AND not greasy AT ALL! Great recipe!
52e17064-14d9-42d0-a7d2-ade94ac19131;wendychan;5;Such an easy recipe. My fried green tomatoes turned out delicious!
52e17064-14d9-42d0-a7d2-ade94ac19131;michaelpruitt;5;This is a very good recipe. I added a little cayenne pepper to the flower to spice it up a bit. The batter sticks to the tomato slices well. I saved this to use again. Thanks!!
52e17064-14d9-42d0-a7d2-ade94ac19131;dwight;4;"Well, this is the closest as I've been able to find to my grandmother's recipe. I,,,,we only have fried green tomatoes when we have Catfish and hushpuppies. I salt the slices for a while and dab off the water. Then I put them in flour and let them set for a while. Before making the hushpuppies, I dredge the catfish in the cornmeal/salt and pepper, and let them set a while. I then dredge the tomatoes in the flour and let them set. I set the table and heat up the deep fryer, then I dip the tomatoes into the egg/milk (instead of water) and then into the cornmeal. I let them set. Each time you let the flour or cornmeal set, it ""glues"" itself to the food. I then mix up the flour egg/milk and cornmeal with some baking powder and minced onion, onion powder and make the hushpuppy dough. Well, I got off the subject, but I hope this helps someone."
52e17064-14d9-42d0-a7d2-ade94ac19131;souplovingnicole;4;"2 cups of cornmeal to the 1 cup of flour if you want that ""gritty"" the Southerns go for. Everyone prefers them differently though. I am from Missouri and so were my grandma's. One did them 2 parts flour to one part cornmeal and the other did 2 parts cornmeal to one part flour so it is just a matter of personal preference I suppose. Either way, the one thing I recommend is lightly salting them right out of the fryer and eat them while they are hot."
52e17064-14d9-42d0-a7d2-ade94ac19131;rsmith;5;This Carolina Girl LOVED it! Add a dash of salt as soon as they come out of the pan!
52e17064-14d9-42d0-a7d2-ade94ac19131;panky;5;My mom and grandmother used to make these.They were very good.I made them for my husband who had never tried them.He thought they were different but very good.
52e17064-14d9-42d0-a7d2-ade94ac19131;cookie734;4;Easy, tangy, and tasty. Make sure you slice your tomatoes thin, so they cook through and through. I would make these again.
475ef578-478a-4216-a9a7-869d3c7f577b;jamieosborne;5;So yummy!
475ef578-478a-4216-a9a7-869d3c7f577b;alleahb;3;I didn't have all the ingredients, so my rating isn't fair. No thyme or dried pepper or lemon. Used perch. So added 1/2 lime, dashes of ole bay seasoning, cayenne, and red pepper flakes. Canned /frozen vegetables instead of fresh.
475ef578-478a-4216-a9a7-869d3c7f577b;reese;5;This hit the spot. NY was 4 degrees today and my husband works outside doing deliveries. He was definitely in need of this. He said it warmed up his soul. Added some shrimp to it and a couple of other seasonings. Added yam instead of regular potatoes and no green banana.
475ef578-478a-4216-a9a7-869d3c7f577b;kurlyy1;3;I'm making this now and it looks amazing! But no idea what type or size of fish. I'm working with what I have on hand so using snapper fillets but I'm wondering if 4 is enough. That depends on the size of fish this recipe calls for..... 3 stars for that but will definitely come and update!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;stu;5;Super refreshing summer-time salad. I followed recipe except tomato’s (veto ingredient at home). I used mix of white and yellow corn.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;coreyp;5;Added cucumber.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;kar;3;This salad fell flat for me. It is missing an acid, which helps to brighten the flavor and balance the sweetness of the corn. You need to add a citrus (like lemon or lime) or vinegar. Once I did, the salad came alive. Make sure to liberally season with salt and pepper.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;ajn;5;Really good! I substitute the olive oil for the juice of one lime, which balances the sweet corn really well.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;moniquedionneconard;5;Oops I forgot in my original review I also added avocado
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;gailandera;5;I used frozen corn and put everything on aluminum foil and on the grill. Worked fine, but I think my grill was a little too hot. Charred on the edges and not in the middle. I'll definitely make this again.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;croatianbear;5;Fabulous base recipe and add whatever other veggies you like, cucumbers, avocado’s etc. Bacon bits also go nicely! Yummy!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;rosemaryyull;5;A great topping for fish tacos add some diced chiles.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;lorawademckinney;4;My crew loved it, I did not use bell peppers, but used a cucumber. Also, it is to early for corn so roasting was not an option, but I will try again when corn is fresh. It seemed a bit bland, so it jazzed it up with cumin and chili powder. It was the perfect accompaniment to enchiladas.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;kay;5;I agree this needs lime juice. I also added avocado, but it took away I also added lime juice and avocado. The juice added a nice tang, but I wouldn't add the avocado again. It felt that it detracted from the nice crunchiness of all the fresh veggies.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;rob;5;Very good! I also added black beans and lime infused olive oil. Also works well with tortilla chips.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;bgjez;5;Big hit with family!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;dj54;5;The family loved it. I will make it again.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;mindygramberg;3;Needs something extra so we added lime juice
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;donnawoodsingram;5;Made this tonight and it was delicious! I made a few adjustments to use ingredients I already had: canned corn, and avocadoes rather than green peppers. This is definitely a dish I will make again, and will try it with fresh corn next time!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;stephlemastersmcvicker;4;Very good, added lime & roasted the corn w/ butter, paprika & S&P. Will add either feta or quesa fresco next time for some additional depth.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;peggyperrin;5;I think I’ll like it.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;amygraham;5;I made this dish tonight and it was fabulous!! I did change it a bit. I sautéed the corn in butter until done and add all the other ingredients!! Delicious and my family loved it!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;jamieshibata;5;Turned out wonderful. We eat this as a main course and lasted 4 days in the fridge without spoiling.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;brandipayne;5;Easy to make and lots of flavor, I used frozen corn and grilled it in a pan.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;leahchossid;4;Used parsley instead of cilantro and added avocado and lime juice.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;mindyjerniganblack;4;Love this salad. I always get asked to bring it to family parties
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;lynnschaper;4;Great taste and beautiful color. Made several variations. Used 1/2 frozen corn because I didn’t have enough cob corn. Added lime. Used coriander since it’s out of season to get cilantro. Used white onion since red onion out of season. Still tasted great. Will pair with great northern beans made into baked beans for meal prep.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;lysabonnchristopher;5;Do not be fooled by it's simplicity. This easy salad is BIG on flavor. Make sure you let it sit in your refrigerator as specified. The flavors really develop and make a wonderful tasting salad that's healthy and flavorful. I made it exactly as directed and my family devoured it. This recipe is a keeper.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;danalevy;4;This was good and I will make it again but with the following changes: add 2 avocados, juice of one whole lime, a 1/2 teaspoon of cumin and a smashed clove of garlic. I let the favors meld overnight. Make sure you add enough salt and pepper as it really needs it. This was turned it up a notch!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;wawa;5;It was out of this world.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;kristysanders;5;Added lime juice and lime zest as the other reviewers suggested and it was phenomenal. I added a touch of poblano pepper, green onion, and red bell pepper. Fantastic dish I will make again and again. Was great as an addition to fish tacos.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;char;5;What a great salad! Loved the unusual taste of the corn. Easy & inexpensive addition f the corn. Will definitely make again!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;terryjones;5;It turned out Fantastic, will make again. I seasoned the corn with EVO and a seasoning I use on my chicken. Didn't need to salt or pepper, just added a sprinkle of Chayanne chili...
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;ballen;5;We are adding this to our regular rotation. I added cucumbers and left out jalapeños because I was out. I also added the lime juice! Yum!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;sandrahavlik;5;It was delicious. I used red pepper instead of green, just my preference. I added one sliced avocado and lime juice Rave reviews from friends at bbq. I think the lime juice just adds that extra bit of zing and freshness. Great summer salad. First time I’ve grilled corn and it was fabulous!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;kate;5;Great base recipe. Did switch green bell for red bell & added diced jalapeno & lime juice. Was awesome on grilled red snapper!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;vasimms;5;This is a great salad. I agree with previous reviewers that lime juice is a must! I squeeze a whole lime. Have added black beans or garbanzo beans as well to bulk it up!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;shonuff;5;tasty stuff.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;kathy;5;Excellent side dish! I used red bell pepper instead of green and some diced jalapeño.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;careyparrowdooley;4;I made it as the recipe directed. It was delicious and fresh.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;dubyad40;5;Grilled the jalapeño, tomato and onion to add a little more smoke. Squeeze of lime and some salt really made it pop. Didn't have cojeta cheese so I used feta. A great bite and contrast to the sweet corn. This is super fast and tasty
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;rock;5;Excellent as is
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;allyh;5;Outstanding! I used orange peppers, grape tomatoes, and made it a day in advance. I also added some lime juice as suggestd by others. Just before serving I added slices avocado . This will be a summer staple!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;gman;5;We love it. I was out of tomatos and substituted an avacado, and used red and orange peppers for color. I used cold leftover grilled corn from a previous dinner, and served the salad cold. Have made it twice already, really good and easy - and easy to just wing it :)
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;j;4;This is a very good recipe especially with fresh corn arriving in our Texas grocery stores currently. I left out the green bell pepper and added fresh lime juice based on other reviews and since I brushed the ears of corn with olive oil prior to roasting I found that the dish did not need the 2 tsp. of olive oil. Also, just because I was in a hurry, I used a corn holder in the end of the cob to aid in cutting the kernels from the cob while they were still hot. It also helped to cool the corn down faster so that the remaining ingredients could be added. All in all this great recipe for all that summer corn that’s here and more on it’s way. I will definitely be using this recipe again. Thanks Amber.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;mardrissa;5;Only thing I would do to this recipe is make more! We added part of a jalapeno to it. Will probably add a whole one next time. But will definitely make it again.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;darlynnhall;5;It is fresh and delicious. Very colorful. I will absolutely make it again! One thing I did differently was to soak the avocado in lemon juice so it wouldn't turn brown.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;robinwalkertomlinson;4;Really good and even better with a little garlic and avocado chunks in it, too!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;jbtinmd;5;We loved it. I will make it again!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;taleashawilliams;4;I did not make any changes and yes I will add this to my recipe binder for the future as well.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;brenda;5;My family was pleasantly surprised with all the flavor! I would definitely make this again.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;dee;5;It was so good! I added a bit of chopped up jalapeno for a touch of spice.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;heather;5;Very easy! I used fresh basil instead of cilantro since that was ready in the garden. I just microwaved my corn (in the husk) instead of grilling.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;karenharrison;4;Overall it is pretty good. I made it twice. Both times I added lime. Next time I will grate the lime to it as well.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;jamie;5;I LOVED this recipe. It was easy and fast to put together. We will be making more of this!!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;mari;2;I thought the taste was just blah. I added extra salt, pepper, olive oil & lime juice, but it really didn't help. I love cilantro in salsa, etc., but it was just overpowering in this dish. I will keep trying to find a good corn salad, won't make this one again. Sorry.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;lala64;5;I made this for a summer cookout gathering and it was a big hit. This will become a staple for all future gatherings. I followed many of the suggested enhancements, doing the following: I used frozen roasted corn instead of grilled. I also added the juice and zest of two limes, one can of drained & rinsed black bans, two avocados and feta cheese. For the dressing, in addition to olive oil, I added approximately 2 tbsps of a citrus salad dressing. I added garlic salt, cumin and paprika. I was very generous with both salt and pepper.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;jbird;5;"I really liked this, used it as a side and also added it to a mixed green salad. You can do somuch with this, add zuchini, cheese, bacon or whatever ;youhave. I also liked the taste of the cilantro, added a little bit of fresh lemon juice. Awesome"
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;hopeorr;3;Be careful about adding cilantro---a little goes a long way. I added additional chopped tomato, and some sugar to refine the taste.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;allrecipesfan;5;I added a 1/2 a lime and an avocado to it to make it more 'summery'. Loved it, took to a picnic and no leftovers were had!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;cara;5;Excellent and a new favorite. The only change I made was omitting the cilantro and adding freshly caramelized garlic.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;elaine;5;I made it with frozen corn slightly defrosted. Mixed with remaining ingredients and put in foil on grill. Cooked while meat was cooking. Tasted great. Served with steak and potatoes.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;evasimpson;4;Very good! We added avocado and lime juice as well! Basically Pico with corn! We also like heat so we used jalapeño instead of green peppers
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;cynthiaguerzon;4;It was delicious almost immediately but even better when I let it marinade for 2 days. I used red peppers instead of green (personal preference) and added just a bit more sugar. Great for camping because I made it ahead of time.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;beth;5;Delicious! I made it as a side to go with tacos but ended up just putting it in the tacos and it was great!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;saji;5;I made it, i add broccoli and carrot it tastes like heaven
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;loulou;5;Loved this easy and is very yummy!!!!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;jeff;5;Was better than I thought it would be very colorfull and was delicous to the palet
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;drewbrew;5;I added a jalapeno to spice it up a little. Very good. I will definitely make this again.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;suenaylor;5;Delicious. I would definitely use this recipe again.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;londonlinn;5;This recipe is a keeper. I added avocado and lime juice
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;brianwhittington;5;Like other said, I added lime, avocado and balsamic vinegar. The whole family loved it. Great pairing with barbecued salmon.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;judisdesigns;4;This was very enjoyable. Next time I will add a few more vegetables though.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;mommamedzie;5;Wonderful! Excellent flavor! I will definitely make it again!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;dongeorge;4;I took the green pepper out and it was great. With the pepper, you might as well have made and all-pepper salad because that is all I could taste.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;njc0423;3;I have made a version of this for years, but this recipe is lacking a key ingredient which is the juice of 2-3 limes. I also only use red peppers as they are milder. A trick to this for the corn is to roast in husks in oven at 400 degrees for 30 minutes. Husks and silk fall off and the taste is just as good, if not better than grilled corn. Bon Apetite!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;tim;4;Great dish ! Followed the directions and turned out great. Will make it again for sure.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;daveparre;4;It was good. Thought it need an acid to bright up the flavors, so I added some basalmic vinegar to the leftover portion. Killed it! Will make it again only next time add the acid at the beginning.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;iloveit;5;EASY GOOD FRESH CONVENIENT I followed recipe with our own preferences. Easy to adapt to what you like. Red pepper, parsley, a few red pepper flakes. Even a few peas.Used the real lime juice and zest. Feta or Tex mex. cheese. Keeps for several days stored well in fridge. Apart from dinner,,just nice to snack on.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;lydiabragg;4;Needed lime juice. 2nd Mods: juice from whole lime, avocado, half an onion, fresh cilantro. Sub half a cucumber for the green bell pepper
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;jesusmontesdeoca;5;i added avocado a can of garbanzo beans and a can of black beans also substituted the red onion for green onion comes out really good with the avocado
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;kelly2;4;it was good but I think it is missing something...like more acid and salt. I think I will play with this again. I like that it is a great seasonal fresh salad.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;candicejohnson;5;Th only change I made was to use frozen Trader Joe's roasted corn! It is already nicely charred, and off the cob. It's delicious in the recipe, AND makes it super easy to make.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;celi;5;A great way to have a fresh cold salad!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;allison;5;This was awesome as a topping on a Cobb salad. I omitted the green pepper and added cucumber, lime juice, red wine vinegar, and a little sugar. I did not have fresh corn so I used 2 cans of fire roasted corn instead and it came out GREAT! I will definitely make this again.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;elizabeth;5;Love grilled corn! I added an avocado, and mixed about 2 T lime juice, 1 T sugar, and about 1/4 C Olive oil for the 'dressing'. I also sprinkled with Queso Fresco because cheese. The grilled corn flavor was awesome, and the avocado added creaminess. I'll definitely make this again!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;anneh;4;I used frozen corn and added a can of black beans. Also used about 1/8 tsp garlic powder and two dashes of red pepper flakes as well as four dashes of Tobasco. Good, but was screaming for avocado.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;elj;5;I only made half of the recipe. That was a mistake because it was absolutely delicious. Even my picky family loved it.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;jenn;5;We made it just as written --we did refrigerate it for almost 5 hours so all the flavors blended before serving. It was delicious-a great summer side dish. A definite repeat !!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;cathiegorman;5;Took to a Mexican Pot Luck and everyone loved it!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;christasheehan;5;Very nice! Made according to directions and ingredients. next time I will add some more spices!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;melanie;5;I tried this recipe for dinner tonight and got rave reviews. After reading some of the other comments, I cleaned out the crisper and added red and yellow peppers instead of green, a can of black beans, cherry tomatoes, lime, balsamic vinegar, and feta. Sadly I was out of cilantro, but it was still delicious. We will be able to enjoy the leftovers tomorrow. Thanks for the flavourful summer dish.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;dotdot;4;Fresh summer taste!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;keribell;5;This was delicious! Only thing I will do different next time is not add the green pepper. I think that overpowered the corn. Thanks!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;thunderbolt;5;Oil the corn before grilling. I added some italian dressing to the salad too or just add cumin and chili powder and lime juice. I also added an orange pepper instead of a green one. I'll also try adding an avocado and black beans or maybe feta cheese next time.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;shoshannah;5;"I didn't have the ears of corn or the green peppers but I took frozen corn and ""grilled"" them in my cast iron skillet with a tiny bit of EVOO. It toasted and grilled them perfectly! I then added it to the remainer of the ingredients in my salad bowl, garnished with cilantro. YUM! Too bad the portions are too small. I would double, even triple the recipe!"
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;davewalton;4;Wasn't as flavorful as I was expecting. I added some cucumber, but think it could have done with a little balsamic. Will add next time.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;molly;4;A very tasty salad using all the fresh produce of the summer. We liked the combination of the ingredients in this salad. The leftovers held up well for lunches the next day. I do think fresh squeezed lime juice would add another dimension to this salad. Thanks AMBERT77, for sharing your recipe.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;wendylyons;4;"5 stars with the reviewer-suggested addition of lime juice (I used 2 small). I also added jalapeno for a little kick and green, orange and red peppers for color (as well as both yellow and white corn). I put in two small avocados as suggested, but it was prettier before adding the avocado, which gave it a creamy consistency. Personally, I don't think the avocado added much to the taste; it didn't detract from the taste either. Next time, I'll just leave it out. I served it at dinner for 8 people. Everyone that tried it really liked it and went back for more."
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;alla;5;Nice and easy
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;judy;3;OK but nothing great
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;liat;4;Very nice and easy salad. Great way to eat cilantro I made it with fresh organic corn which can be eaten without being cooked at all and it was great. Added a bit of lime juice which was in place. Can vary the vegetables , adding cucumber and such. Well be made again!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;waha;5;A family favorite but with a can of rinsed, drained black beans and instead of olive oil, the Red Wine Vinegar dressing by 7 Seas. Delicious.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;kevinowens;5;This is almost exactly my recipe for Maque Choux. I don't put creme in my Maque Choux, so this is pretty much it. Had it last night with shrimp and grits. Everybody loves it. I - like some other reviewer added smoked paprika and didn't think it went very well. At times I have added cucumber, olives, pineapple, tomatoes or avocado. I think it looks best on a plate with red bell pepper or tomato.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;davena;5;Loved this recipe. I did add a vinaigrette (with lime juice) for the dressing and additional peppers (red, yellow). This was a huge hit and great with all the corn available this time of year.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;diane;5;Very tasty salad. I grilled 2 extra corn on the cobs last night. I made the recipe to feed 2 people. I got enough corn off the cobs to actually feed 4 people. I put extra tomato in the salad. Hubby will not eat any color of bell pepper so had to leave it out. I tasted it and it really did need lime juice so added some to the recipe. The roasted corn has it`s own natural sweetness so it was perfect. I will be making this salad through out the summer.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;daymon;5;Can use fresh or frozen corn. Added a dash of paprika, about 1/2 tsp cumin, a can of black beans & one avocado. Easy & delicious.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;chickscook;5;This salad rocks! I was looking for a healthy, tasty side dish for a camping trip with family and I found it with this salad. I added a chopped avacado, fresh lime juice and jalapeno. Everyone loved it!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;bonnielucas;5;I was looking for a way to use up some frozen cobbettes and this seemed like a good way. Actually it turned out absolutely fantastic. Aside from using the cobbettes (which we did grill) the only adjustments I made were to add a splash of lime juice as others suggested and to use more tomato. We absolutely loved it!!!! We can't wait to try it with fresh corn and see if it can actually get better!!!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;carrie;4;My husband LOVED this! He couldnt' wait to eat the leftovers!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;elizabethatwatercling;4;Added one can of black beans, a chopped avocado, some cumin and balsamic vinegar. Definitely going to make it again!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;mdb;5;I used cherry tomatoes sliced, omitted the green pepper, added an avocado diced, lime juice and lime zest and it was outstanding. Definetly needs the lime and avocado.
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;jillian;4;"Overall, very good! Plus it's a great way to use up leftover grilled corn. I subbed cucumber for the green pepper as a personal preference. And I definitely agree with some of the other reviewers that this needs lime juice. I also added a bit of sugar to the ""dressing"" and let this set in the fridge for a few hours to let the flavors blend together. Very simple, very tasty and bursting with color!"
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;denise;5;VERY good - I added lime juice (1/2 a lime) and it was delicious!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;jaime;3;I didn't prefer this by itself, but I put it on nacho's with some cheese and spicy sauce and it added so much depth of flavor to a finger food. Tasty!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;erinsheldon;5;I made this salad for a party. I was rushed so I used frozen corn kernels and I added diced avocado. It was awesome!! Great recipe!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;cheryl;4;would have given it five stars but there was way too much cilantro. next time i will only use 1/4 bunch cilantro. it was also better the next day. good recipe, thanks!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;mistidawnkemmer;5;I love this recipe. I make it slightly different. I use red or yellow bell peppers because I can't stand the taste of green peppers, and I add about half a small container of feta cheese to the salad, and a few dashes of cayenne pepper. It is perfect to accompany a barbequed dinner!
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;lisa;5;Great recipe, I did add some cucumber since i have so many from my garden. A definate keeper
883166cc-98ac-4648-9f5b-6bbe4fa659a1;pattycakes;5;What a good hearty stew is to the cold winter months, this refreshing Grilled Corn Salad is to a hot summer day! I made fish stick tacos and used this salad as a topping for it. I squeezed some lime on. The lime,tomato and chili pepper all came from my back yard. It was a quick and simple to put together. I had grilled off the corn last week and used that. I had everything on hand and tasted terrific!Thank You Amber, this will be a regular around my table!

913fb113-322b-44ac-9d66-0f43e205e144;lise;5;My go to for beef stock. I use oxtails instead of marrow bones.
913fb113-322b-44ac-9d66-0f43e205e144;lori;4;I made this but instead of tomato paste I used a large can of crushed tomatoes then 4 celery ribs 1/2 Of a small red onion & 1 large carrot. After all the marrow was gone from bones I took them out. I simmered for more then 24 hours. This took a two day period then added a 16 oz. Bag of mixed frozen veggies. The soup was amazing & loved by all!
913fb113-322b-44ac-9d66-0f43e205e144;nicholashowe;5;I followed the recipe as it was written. Made a very rich broth. I used the beef bones, I personally like beef better. I also pulled out the bay leaf and blended the vegetables and fat left over into a paste consistent. I put into my ice tray to freeze and will use it when I make any stews. It will add more flavor to my stews.
913fb113-322b-44ac-9d66-0f43e205e144;junebug;3;It was just ok.
913fb113-322b-44ac-9d66-0f43e205e144;love2cook;4;I didn't use tomato paste and added 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar, to help leach the bones, but otherwise stayed true to the recipe. The broth was good, but is greatly enhanced with salt and pepper, when used.
913fb113-322b-44ac-9d66-0f43e205e144;lloydglennpennjunior;5;I thought it was perfect but I will add a small amount of salt for the next batch.
913fb113-322b-44ac-9d66-0f43e205e144;dewey;5;Excellent, flavorful broth. Next time I may add some white wine as part of the water.
913fb113-322b-44ac-9d66-0f43e205e144;wicksy;4;I didn't use the tomato paste but otherwise follow the recipe. I have read recently that adding about 1/4 cup vinegar to the water and letting the bones sit in it for about half hour before turning on the heat help leach more minerals out of the bones so I always do this now with all my broth. Always have homemade broth in the freezer, so handy and much cheaper , tastier and healthier than store bought! Love drinking on it's own, esp during the winter
913fb113-322b-44ac-9d66-0f43e205e144;aemcclung;5;This was wonderful broth that I made into a beef and vegetable soup. I will do this again!
913fb113-322b-44ac-9d66-0f43e205e144;coreen;5;I made this and used it as a base in beef stew. Beef stew is something I have been making (similar to the way my husband's mom made it) for close to 10 years and I have always felt it was missing something. This was it! when making the stew I added water, only 2 beef boullion, garlic powder, oregano, and pepper and it was great! I may play with seasonings next time but will make this recipe the same! Very good! Thank you for the recipe!
913fb113-322b-44ac-9d66-0f43e205e144;drumac;5;Save beef, chicken, pork, lamb bones to Kay this delish nutrient rich broth. I leave the tomato paste out because I use this broth in place of store bought broth in all my recipes. Here's another trick. All those pieces and peels of veggies you have when you cook...keep a container in the freezer. Toss the remnants in the container. Every month. Cook yourself up more bone broth. I do mine in a slow cooker for at least 24 hours. The longer it cooks the more concentrated the flavor. Stay away from using cruciferous veggies in the pot. They can leave a weird after taste. Use everything else. I add dried or fresh herbs towards the end. Dried mushrooms and a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar for brightness. Totally optional. I let the mixture cool, strain to get the bits out, and then pour into quart or pint mason jars and freeze. Leave about an inch of space between the broth and the jar lid. They keep in the freezer for 6 months. Again, use in place of store bought stock. It is so worth it. Easy clean up with a slow cooker liner. You can make it in a stock pot on the stove or in the oven. Low and slow is best. Pressure cooker if you're in a hurry. Add more water if necessary to keep everything surged if you are cooking on the stove, slow cooker, or oven.
913fb113-322b-44ac-9d66-0f43e205e144;nancyhensley;5;I didnt follow the recipe exactly but can tell it had a good base to it. I added a teaspoon of marjoram and a cup of celery. I let everyone salt there own soup for some in our family has health issues and cant have much salt. I used our electric pressure cooker and timed for 25 minutes. Our family loved it.
913fb113-322b-44ac-9d66-0f43e205e144;karenantonellimaddox;5;Love the recipe, been using this in my family for decades
913fb113-322b-44ac-9d66-0f43e205e144;koz;4;I don't use tomato paste. I freeze vegetable trimmings and bones that I would normally discard. When I get a good amount, I make a broth out of them as described above. I freeze the broth in an ice cube tray. When I want to add some broth to a recipe, just pop out an ice cube tray.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;cmach;5;I have never cared for lima beans but on a dare from my sisters for all 4 of us (who loved my southern grandma’s cooking) to choose 1 item we hated and try again. I was tasked with limas. After reading reviews from others in my boat that changed their tune with this recipe I gave it a whirl and am so glad! I have now made these 3 times! I did cut the recipe in half and used a bit of butter (like Grandma would have) for cooking the onions instead of spray but otherwise as written. I simmered about 20 minutes. Yum!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;douginmanhattan;5;"I've often used a combination of add-ins with frozen (and cooked!) lima beans : a sparing amount of unsalted butter or EVOO; grated Parmesan or Romano cheese (which provide enough saltiness); ground or rubbed sage; a light sprinkle of black pepper or crushed red pepper flakes (chili flakes); a faint or very light sprinkle of garlic powder; a tiny amount of Dijon mustard (but be careful: if you add too much, it will take over); stuffed Manzanilla olives (sliced or chopped) or Kalamata olives (likewise sliced or chopped; and, again, if you add too many, they'll take over, too); and some walnuts (either the kind sold as halves and pieces, or chopped)."
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;suziestallings;5;So easy and delicious!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;lutzflcat;5;5.9.22 I used fordhook lima beans instead of baby limas, just personal preference. These larger limas were cooked when I checked for doneness at 15 minutes. I’d recommend watching your time, so you don’t end up with mushy beans. One small thing I will change in the future will be using larger onions, either chopped larger or small half slices. Although the onion flavor was there, the finely-chopped onions just really cooked down, and I would have liked an occasional bite of onion along with my beans. Minor thing, but this was a nice side dish to some pork chops and sweet potatoes.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;fruitdog;5;I am not a fan of lima beans but the BF is. I used butter, red onion and only had canned beans...because he likes them. Because they were canned, I also used chicken bouillon and the broth they came in. I am still not a fan, but he was thrilled...guess I'll have to make these again.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;bekivaupelbegalka;4;We like it with garlic and veggie stock!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;paula;5;Great recipe. I added some andouille sausage

4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;mokismudgemuffin;5;Very, very good. I typically don't care much for lima beans, I think they're just so-so. My husband loves limas , though, so i make them for him. This recipe makes them so creamy and flavorful that I want more, and I'm making them now for a 2nd time. I like to serve these beans with brown rice, about a 2- or 3-1 ratio with more beans than rice. Rice isnt much more than an accent, but helps to round out the meal.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;terri;5;Good but needs some seasoning to add flavor. Will make again
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;keepitsimple;3;I made these exactly according to the recipe. They were good, but not outstanding. I will probably make them again because they were so easy.

I thought this recipe sounded great and the reviews were pretty good too. I used the recipe plus some of the suggestions from others-bacon grease, fresh minced garlic, extra salt and pepper, butter.

4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;acacandy;5;I used a bag of large lima beans (they started out white in color) and used a base of leftover onion soup instead of chicken broth.

They are, however, nothing like the mealy, unpleasant limas I remember from my childhood, so that was a pleasant surprise.

4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;ctcountrygal;5;Made this for the first time the other day and it was very tasty. I added a clove of garlic and used 1/2c of dried lima beans instead to the 1 1/2c. of chicken broth. I pressured cooked on high for 16 minutes.

4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;mandy;5;I've always loved lima beans, but the way I grew up eating them was FAR from healthy. None of my cookbooks had any suggestions for me, so I came back to my trusty Allrecipes.com. Again, it hasn't let me down. This recipe is a keeper. Like some of the other reviewers, I also like to play around with some spices with this recipe. I've tried cayenne, red pepper flakes, and garlic powder so far. Yum yum! Can't wait to do some more experimenting.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;pomona;4;Very good as is ... even better if you cook 3 strips of bacon, remove the bacon then saute the onions in that.

4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;usmcwife;3;good but kind of bland
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;emilynicole;5;Wonderful. I used dry beans. I did the quick soak method to soak the beans and then I cooked them until they were soft with onion and garlic. once soft i added better than boulin and some pepper. and cooked them till they were thick enough to eat. If I cook a while bag of beans before I add the chicken stock I portion out the beans for the freezer and then cook what i want for that night with the seasoning.

Since I used more beans I upped the butter to 2 Tbsp., the mustard to 1 1/4 tsp. and the lemon juice to 2 Tbsp. Left the sugar alone so it wasn't so sweet - may reduce this even more in future.

After simmering for 30 minutes, mix 2 TBSP of corn starch with 2 TBSP water then add to beans. Turn heat to high and boil for about 3-4 minutes stirring occasionally until thickened. This makes a fantastic gravy for your beans to swim in. The gravy kicks things up a level!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;angelicaporfido;4;This lima beans recipe was awesome!!!!!! Made it for dinner and my daughter who is 24 loved it. Would definately, make it again
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;keishad;4;I am relatively new to cooking. I am not a fan of lima GREAT!!! I have a picky four year old and he was eager to eat these beans. Even my fiancee enjoyed the meal that I made with these lima beans. He usually uses turkey to season his beans, but thought the chicken stock worked well. A great veggie recipe that I will use again!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;staciabrannon;5;LOVE IT! Tweeked a little. Sauted using olive oil. Doubled the recipe, used very large Vidalia onion. Used spike seasoning, salt, pepper. Used electric skillet. Used 3 cups water and 3 chicken boullon cubes. About tablespoon of butter. No more water was needed. Simmered in electric skillet until beans soft. Resulted in some creamy sauce when done. It turned out awesome! Sweet, buttery, melt in your mouth beans. WOW!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;wesbritt;5;Very easy and very good!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;avaledon;4;This recipe is pretty good. As a poor college student, I added some smoked turkey slices to it at the end and made it a meal.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;trivexta;5;Always thought Lima Beans were bland and boring, NOT anymore - great recipe! I keep frozen Lima's in my freezer at all times now for this recipe.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;carol;5;I have lived in the South my entire life, but can't make good ole' butter beans. These are a slightly different take and we all loved them. I chopped the onion super fine.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;quimika28;5;REALLY GOOD AND SOFT .
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;kristieghioni;5;My husband said he really didn't like lima beans, now he does. They are really high in potassium whech he needs. I did add a can of Rotel tomatoes at the end after draining. He ate them all up.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;lisa;5;Best and easiest lima bean receipe ever!! I used a pat of real butter to saute onions and then added in my reduced sodium chix broth and limas. It was so yummy my husband has requested them again and again!!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;tabycat;3;This was a good recipe..I am glad I tried it. I am not a huge fan of lima beans but it was nice eating lima beans with a different twist than your normal lima bean.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;lisa;5;Super easy, super tasty! Even my husband (not normally a lima eater) enjoyed these-a definite keeper!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;pam;5;These are absolutely the best! Easy, flavorful, and reheat well.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;christopherball;4;This recipe was pretty good. I think that I will add more salt and some garlic next time.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;heather;5;I made these for Thanksgiving and they were a big hit. I kept the onions big so I could pick them out and I added butter near the end of cooking. I will definitely be making these again
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;cornflakegirl;5;This is THE BEST lima bean recipe! I always have to double it or it will be gone in no time. I ususally saute some turkey sausage, ham, or bacon first and use the leftover drippings to saute the onion. My boyfriend won't go for em without some type of meat in there. But I think they are fabulous by themselves. Even my picky 7 year old daughter loves them! Thank you!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;rachael;5;Great beans!!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;genb;5;Made this and it was AWESOME!!! Did not have much onion, but did have some pearl onion in the freezer. I will always cook the dish that way. Very tasty and easy dish, thank you!!!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;karlapatterson;4;"Great low fat alternative way to make ""butter beans"". However, I still love the original way more."
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;gderrthedysfunctional;4;this was easy and simple. i used fresh baby limas and half a vidallia onion and real butter and added fresh okra as well served this with pig-butt , mac and cheese and fresh maters. very nice southern meal. thx.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;zopooh;5;I give these 5 just for reminding me 1) how good limas can be and 2) sometimes the simplest preparation really is the best. Yum! Thanks for the recipe
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;bergy;5;This is indeedan easy recipe and very tasty. I served the beans with left over cabbage rolls and garden fresh carrots. This is a do again recipe
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;tofu19;4;I followed the recipe exactly except for using canola oil rather than cooking spray. It turned out very good and as a non-lima fan, that is saying a lot.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;dijen1;5;This was the first year we tried growing lima beans in the garden. I love baby lima beans, but have always just cooked them from frozen, which is what this recipe called for, but I decided to try this with the fesh picked beans. Oh My Goodness. These were delicious, maybe the best I have ever had. I will definately do this again, either fresh or frozen.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;sharonb013;5;This is my recipe so of course I love it! I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who took the time to cook, try, fiddle with, and review this recipe. I love the suggestions and will be trying some of them myself. If you haven't yet tried these lima beans, good luck and enjoy!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;melissaraesmith;5;This was the first time I've made Lima Beans and I loved them. They had a mild flavor, which I like, and made a super healthy side (which I like even more). Just add some salt and pepper. Yum
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;sunduri;5;I used College Inn Chicken Broth with Roasted Garlic and 2 tsp dried diced onion because I didn't have regular chix broth or fresh onion. It really turned out delish! Tasted rich, like there was butter in the mix, but without all the guilt. I'll definitely spruce up frozen lima beans this way again!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;ericaw;5;These are fantastic. Very easy. I added seasalt and ground black pepper once I added the beans to the water. Will definetely make again. Thanks!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;jamieoslawski;5;Add a little salt and pepper and you're set.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;court;5;Tasty & healthy dish, but I didn't like the onion texture in these, so I substitute 1/2 tsp of onion powder. You also can substitute bouillon for the broth. Salt to taste.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;christyr;5;"After trying a few different lima bean recipes that my 5-year-old hated I tried this one. Finally, we have a winner! She told me to ""always make lima beans this way because they're JUST right"". Can't argue with that!"
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;loladoo;5;I usually don't cook limas at home because I know they will never be as good as those I used to get at the restaurant I worked at in high school, but this recipe comes close. First time I made it, I was too impatient and didn't let them simmer long enough. Though a little hard for my taste, they were still outstanding. When I let them cook the full time, they were to die for!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;paula;5;Used 2 cans chicken broth, 1 hot pepper, and 1 tsp. sugar. Delicious!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;sharon28;4;These were great! Made them last night after I realized I didn't have any BBQ sauce to make lima beans the way I usually do. We were all pleasantly surprised at the outcome. However, I do need to mention that I used 2 tbs. onion powder and 1 tsp. minced garlic in them instead of chopped onion. Wonderful!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;twinflorida;3;This was good, but not much different from the way I usually do lima beans. I've never met a bean I didn't like! I have to take issue with the reviewer who preached to southerners. The reviewer painted with a very broad brush. Yes, there is obesity among many southerners as with other parts of the country, but a very large number are fit and watch what they eat. Some, unfortunately, cannot afford to eat healthy.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;paulainchicagoil;3;The original recipe seemed a little flat so I improvised. First I omitted the water, broth was more then enough liquid. I sauteed shallots & garlic in butter instead of cooking spray. Simmered the beans on low for about 30 minutes and took the lid partially off so the beans would absorb the remaining broth. Once the beans were cooked completely, I added more butter, Creole seasoning salt and pepper. DELISH!!!!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;patty;5;Great as is...thank you
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;missbd;5;DELICIOUS!I will never cook lima beans another way again!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;momma2kinsey;5;I can't usually get my husband to eat lima beans at all, but this recipe made them interesting enough even for him. I loved them as well and will for sure make this again!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;preta75;3;I can't say its bad but it is nothing spectacular. I rather make Lima beans with canned tomatoes, in a more Greek manner.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;tab;5;Great way to cook lima beans. We all liked them very much. I cooked mine in the crock pot all day. Turned out wonderful!! I had a bag of dried baby limas that I cleaned and soaked over night. I added more chicken broth and only put 1/2 tablespoon of dried minced onion also a little sea salt. They smelt great all day and leftovers froze well.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;kovianqueen;5;I have never been a big fan of lima beans, but really like Glory brand...when I saw this recipe, I hoped it would be as good as Glory, but homemade and reasonably healthy. It is that and SOOOO GOOD! I really, really like this recipe and it will be mine from now on!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;tanyariendeau;4;My husband asked for Lima Beans for Fathers day and I decided to try these and he loved them. The first time I made them with chicken boullion which he much prefered over the canned chicken broth I used the second time. I will make these again, with bouillon
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;pattyf;5;My husband and I love lima beans and this was a simple, tasty way to prepare them. It was very good.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;erinkaren;4;These were good. I was expecting more flavor. They are better if you add salt.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;abbey;5;I used to hate lima beans-not anymore.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;candicerotenduffy;4;Straight forward and so very easy. The only reason it got a four from me is because I felt it needed some salt. Will definitley use this recipe every time I make lima beans now!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;micheleb;4;Very good, everyone enjoyed them. The only suggestion would be for some salt and pepper before serving. Thank you for the recipe.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;leighannmixonlinney;3;Too bland.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;ronaldboyle;4;I love these lima beans, if your in a rush use dried flake onions.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;jeanne;4;This recipe is really good. I grew up eating lima beans and serve them to my family as well. I have always lived in the South and have never added butter to lima beans as stated in other reviews.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;littlduck15;4;Very good & easy recipe for lima beans. Took a little less time to cook than stated in recipe. Will definitely be making this again. Didn't give it five stars because I found it a bit flat tasting.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;jennhorton;4;Pretty good. I have made these 3 times, two without onions. The broth gives it nice flavor and that is even better when it's reheated. I'm sure I will make these again. Limas are one of my favs.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;nancy;5;I love lima beans IF they are straight from the garden. This is an easy, delicious way to prepare them. I started the limas in the chicken broth while I cooked the onions to cut down on cooking time.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;auntwendy9;5;Great recipe! I skipped out on the onions because we were having onions with something else. My boyfriend LOVES lima beans and said he really liked them fixed this way!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;leila;4;"This was okay. I added a little bit of garlic powder. The festive color and mild flavor made it a good pair with reubens. No ""wow"" factor, but easy enough to make again."
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;carrietemp;5;This recipes is delicious. It makes the beans much more flavorful. I also used the regular sized lima beans. I also used a red onion and sauteed it in butter till the onion was slightly browned. Sprinkled some salt and pepper as well. Very easy and delicious recipe!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;tijuana;5;Very good & the only way I can eat them. Thanks for the recipe.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;cherinhall;5;These lima beans were the best I've ever made. I used chicken stock to heat the limas and also added 1 Tbsp. of pan drippings from our turkey to add flavor. I did not add onion to the beans, and did not need any salt or pepper. The family loved the beans which made me really happy.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;nellieja;2;These didn't taste so good. Hubby ended up draining the broth and adding milk and butter. Tasted somewhat better.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;foodymom;5;Good, easy, what else do could you ask for?
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;zusjames;5;Too easy and too yummy.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;jeanj;4;This is a great way to make limas tasty. I used a lot more onion which I sauteed in a little olive oil. My husband won't touch limas with a ten foot pole so more for me. I had a bowl of leftovers for my lunch and they were just as good as the night before at supper.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;meemeebuluga;4;Tasty. I added about 1 tsp of butter and a little pepper. The beans come out plump and have a nice delicate flavor.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;mississippirobin;5;My son hates lima beans, but loved this recipe. I used olive oil instead of cooking spray and also added 1 clove of garlic.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;jenae;2;When I first found this recipe and read the reviews, I was really excited. I thought maybe I had found an easy way to make lima beans taste the way I remembered them tasting when my mom made them. After trying the recipe out, I was so disappointed. These were so BLAND. I even added some extra seasoning because of the reviews. These need a lot of seasoning!!!!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;myprettypeonies;4;I got mixed reviews on these. My mom loved them, but my husband didn't. I forgot to let the broth come to a boil, so my beans ended up being a little mushy. I also didn't use any spray or onion, as recommended by others here. I would make them again, but let the broth boil first and not store the leftovers in the broth.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;karenmccleanemullin;4;Boy, this dish surprised me because I am not a lima bean eater (only like them in soups) but it really wasn't bad. I made them for my husband and he also liked them. They were very tender and tasted great.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;hotmama;4;i was pleasantly surprised at how tasty lima beans could be!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;sunnylluvsya07;3;Very creamy and delicious, it was much better with the onions drained out.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;tjohnson034;3;I really don't care for lima beans but was hoping this recipe would change my mind--it didn't. :( My kids, however, seemed to like them pretty well. They ate these just about as well as the canned. Since this is not something we all enjoy, I will probably stick with the canned.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;sharonbolar;4;I am not a lima bean fan, but I liked them
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;chrissydecosmofessler;5;I personally do not care for lima beans but my hubby and daughter said they were excellent and gave them a 5! They said the chicken broth added such a nice flavor to the beans.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;thecattlemanswife;4;Really good, but the little onions weren't great while eating the beans. I would suggesting keeping them in large chucks and then straining out before serving.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;ginah1;5;This is a quick and tasty side dish!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;lkennay;5;for all you lima bean lovers down south, you don't need the fattening butter to make good limas........this is wonderful
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;cruisem;4;Very Good!! The only change that I made was to use olive oil instead of cooking spray. Delicious and no guilt. Thanks!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;sherelb;5;These turned out great! This is the way I will always make them from now on.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;anniecohen;5;I don't care for lima beans, but my husband requested them as a side for dinner last night. I found this recipe, made it, and I am converted to a lima bean lover! I used regular lima beans (frozen) since that's what we had and I sauteed the onion in butter. I only simmered the beans for 15 minutes and they turned out so creamy on the inside and delicious. We'll be having this again soon!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;queennmab;4;Pretty good. Anything that gets Mab to eat vegetables=good.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;klara;5;Easy and great!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;samanthastinson;4;These were pretty good but definitly need a little more spicing. I added pepper and garlic powder but some salt would have been nice.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;wilemon;4;Very good. When the limas were done, I drained them, then added a little Country Crock, garlic salt, and pepper.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;bookchickadee;5;These lima beans were outstanding. I did add pepper and garlic powder so a little seasoning. I usually boil mine in water, butter, and brown sugar. I thought I would try something different since I'm trying to cut out on sugars. We all loved this recipe SOOOO much! This will be the only way I make them from now on! Thanks for an awesome recipe!
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;dglong;5;I am NOT a green vegetable fan, but my father in law loves limas. So when he asked for them for his birthday dinner, I came right to this site. And as usual, it didn't let me down! This recipe was wonderful-- easy and very tasty. I think I ate more than my FIL! The only deviation I made was I sauteed the onion in bacon grease and added butter before serving. No wonder I liked them! Seriously, easy and good.
4fa22b01-322a-45bb-a89a-eed3405093c9;shannonhewett;5;I didn't quite make this recipie as stated, but I am sure it would be great. I didn't add any onion, as I didn't have any on hand. But would also be great with onion. I also added 1 tbsp of butter, just for butter's sake. Next time I will make it without butter, for a lowfat dish. It did need a dash of salt and pepper for seasonigs. I will make these nice, moist, flavorful beans again.
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;donnab46;2;I think this is terrible. It tastes like powerful vinegar and celery seed. I never review but had to give my opinion on this one. It does taste sweet as someone else mentioned. Did not change a thing. Would not recommend
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;sue;5;Was so easy.
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;chauntelle46marie;5;Followed recipe and my husband and i both loved it! Will definitely make this again.
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;graymouser;5;Very good! Especially if you need a sauerkraut fix and dont want to run to the store for the real thing.
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;behrfootcook;5;My husband and I love this sauerkraut recipe and I've made it several times now. I haven't tweaked it as I don't think it needs it. It's not as strong as store bought sauerkraut, easy to make, delicious, and stores in the fridge for several months in Mason jars.
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;michaelkrause;5;"Although I made sauerbraten once before, this was my first attempt at making another ""sauer"". This recipe is simple and the result is terrific. However, I still haven't actually made sauerkraut. I substituted spaghetti squash for cabbage and while the consistency is different from that of cabbage, I'll recommend using spaghetti squash to others."
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;marciabrown;4;We are away from our home for 3 months, is my only excuse and I don’t have all of the ingredients at hand. My changes were, I don’t have any celery seed but I have celery. I chopped about a half of a rib very fine, along with a very small carrot. I used white wine vinegar and white vinegar and probably 3 times the salt and a little mustard seed. It still needed a little sweet something. We don’t have any sugar but I do have some balsamic vinaigrette. I added a little of that to sweeten it just a bit. I’m sorry, I don’t generally measure my ingredients. It’s all by taste......even when I’m home!
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;ksantos;5;Husband RAVED about this! Sauerkraut isn’t really my thing, I didn’t love it. But he said it was amazing.
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;giselle;5;Really easy and really tasty!
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;mjr;5;I had no idea it was this easy. Will make again.
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;karenmurphy;5;Easy, tangy, and yummy! Will definitely make this again.
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;aburt104;5;Delicious and super easy!! I added about 1/2 cup more vinegar (I like it tangy), and it was perfect!! I won’t need to buy any from now on!! I ended up canning what we didn’t eat, so we can use it later!
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;stacedeshields;5;Tasty, as written. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe.
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;se;5;This tasted fantastic with kielbasa and a little mustard! Will make again.
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;leef;4;I made it as written. Then adjusted it to our tates adding more vinegar, salt and sugar. I never thought of making Homemade Sauerkraut as needed, thanks for sharing!
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;rick;5;Decided to try this rather than make the time consuming effort to ferment cabbage for a week. Glad I did because this produces very good Sauerkraut very quickly. Far better than store bought. I did not tamper with the recipe, except to add carrots, but probably will do so in the future. Plan to try different vinegar and whole caraway/mustard seed.
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;srhamilton007;5;SOOOO GOOD!! made a few adjustments, but such a quick amazing base recipe. Added mustard seed, chili flake, extra salt & dill seed. Used celery salt because we had no celery seed. Used Champagne vinegar instead of Distilled white. Twice as much spice as recommended.
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;mindaleebriaddy;5;I needed this fast for homemade Reubens! Thank you!!!
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;tbusby;5;5 stars because of the ease of making this and the taste! If I knew it was this easy to make sauerkraut I would have done it years ago. Thank you for the recipe. I did use apple cider vinegar and I only had onion salt, not powder, but it's still delicious.
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;cindyinbay;5;I was impressed with the ease of this recipe. I made this with Schweinbraten Pork Roast from this site. What a wonderful New Years' Day meal that made!
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;crosenberg;5;I absolutely love this recipe. It’s easy and so good!
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;cs1979;5;Quick, easy to make, mild flavor
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;piij;5;Awesome! Added diced apples like my grandma did and wow brings back great memories of making sauerkraut the old fashioned way!
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;katireen;4;Really good! I will say though, I started with jarred Bubbie's sauerkraut from whole foods. I only used half the ingredients and it was still good. I used celery seed, ground black pepper, garlic powder, dried minced onion and apple cider vinegar. Just warmed in a pot on the stove. I was using this to mix with mashed potatoes.
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;victoriagrunerhartman;4;"I made this on a whim one night to go with some amazing sausages. I tasted as I cooked and made a few changes; 1. I cooked longer than the recipe calls for. 2. I added more vinegar and a little apple cider vinegar to achieve desired tartness ( sourness?). This is our go to sauerkraut recipe now."
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;mamoles;2;I made no changes. Not enough whang. Not cooked enough, although I cooked it 15 minutes. (The cabbage made a squeaky sound when I chewed it.) Not salty enough. So, I am cooking it some more, added more salt, and added more vinegar.
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;teresaknight;5;Perfectly Delicious!!!! I made it according to instructions and I will continue to make it. Even better than what I purchased at the store!!!
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;lindakrueger;4;I think it just needed more time to absorb the flavors.
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;stacy;5;very tasty. used for Reuben and son and hubby said they were the best ever.
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;luannsuhr;2;No changes to recipe. It was easy to make but not super delicious. For me the taste is off. It tastes kind of sweet but you can clearly taste the onion powder. It is edible just not delicious. I would not make this again . ~ My mom loves sauerkraut and said it made the house smell really bad.
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;ellenb5;5;I wanted to make a sweet version, so I used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar. It was very easy to make - and delicious!
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;scratchbakercr;4;I'm not a big sauerkraut fan so I made this more for my husband than myself. It was quick and easy to make without the weeks of waiting and did have good flavor. I will most likely use this recipe again when making a meal that requires sauerkraut.
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;leechowning;4;tastes almost exactly like sauerkraut, but without the weeks of waiting
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;rjcb3;5;I used a little less vinegar and skipped the onion powder in liue of extra onion. I cooked it up in my 5qt cast iron Dutch Oven pot, so, instead of keeping the high heat, as soon the liquid came to a boil, I turned it to low to simmer. It was amazing with some sausage and potatoes.
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;rebelrally;5;this was the best sauerkraut ever, much better than the store bought stuff. had it on corned beef sandwiches, with thousand island dressing. wow great. I ate it out of the bowl. very easy to make, fast and easy. I did add 1 teaspoon of sugar and some caraway seed. will make often
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;michelle;5;Added sausage and craisins. Ummm
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;chrisinthekitchen;5;I have never made sauerkraut before, so I tried this. Reading the other reviews, I thought I'd make it more flavorful by adding my own touches. Don't do what I did! I added an extra half cup of vinegar and a quarter cup of water because I used a huge head of cabbage plus a minced jalapeno, 1/2 red pepper, and a whole onion. I also added a tsp. of whole caraway seeds (probably a good idea) and 1/2 tsp. of mustard seed (BAD idea) and a whole tsp. of celery seed. (probably okay) and a whole tsp. of onion powder (probably okay). The mustard seed and extra vinegar kind of ruined it (it tastes like pickled cabbage) but otherwise it would have been really fabulous. I added some extra water and simmered it extra long so hopefully it will mellow out a bit. It is way too sour with the amount of vinegar I used.
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;arecek;5;Made this last night....followed the recipe except used white wine instead of water. It was a big hit!
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;savannahlynn;5;I had to wing it a tad, I cooked an 18 pound head of cabbage. It tasted amazing, reminded me of the sauerkraut I had growing up at a Bohemian restaurant
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;titi;5;I forgot the sauerkraut when I was at the store but had cabbage so looked this up. It was easy, cooked in no time and I like it more than the the store bought! As someone else mentioned it does taste more the Bavarian style which I also prefer.
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;terrvu;4;I rarely eat sauerkraut, but thought this was simple and good. I did add sugar, and used powder mustard instead of the celery salt. I sautéed the cabbage a bit before adding the vinegar/water mixture. made me crave some sausage.
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;janetgoodwin;4;This was good, I added 1 tsp. sugar, super easy and better than store bought, I will make it again.
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;sfravn;5;Very tasty! As a few others I did not have celery seed (and was at the super market earlier too, shoot!). So I substituted mustard seed. Then everything also per instructions. Came out great. Looking forward to the many dishes I'll use it with. Sausages, sandwiches, egg scramble. Can't wait to share with friends tomorrow. Definitely a keeper and will make over and over again. But first, headed back to the pot with my tasting spoon.
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;rhondamaukdeskins;5;Followed recipe exactly and loved it!
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;khines;5;Hubby loved it! I didn't have celery seed so substituted with fennel. Very tasty. Paired with some Weisswurt and steamed potatoes. Prost!
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;kaare;5;We love this recipe! it is so easy to make and all I had was red onion which worked out just great! Won't buy store-bought sauerkraut anymore.
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;stephanievenema;5;Never again will I buy store bought sauerkraut again. Will make over and over. Loved it! Thanks for sharing.
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;aprilmcneilbrooks;5;Followed recipe except used white wine vinegar instead of regular white vinegar and it was the best sauerkraut I have ever eaten! So easy and quick!! Thank you so much for posting this recipe:-)
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;diana;5;Perfect! Has those onions in it as well which I think makes it that much better! Love the extra spices, find other recipes way to bland! Good job!
b01e827c-6999-4dbc-be26-54f93b052e98;pattig;5;This was awesome for quick and easy, last minute sauerkraut!
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;joker37075;5;I thought it was wonderful, the only change I made was that I used fresh Okra and tomatoes, but also used canned Stewed tomatoes. Everything else was as the recipe directed.
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;marysandlinrowell;5;Delicious! Went with fresh okra and fresh tomatoes and went by the recipe otherwise. Best I have ever made!
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;caldwell3004;5;This is a great recipe! I used 1lb of fresh okra and 2.3lbs of fresh tomatoes from my garden. Also added 1tbls. of fresh oregano garlic and onion powder.
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;jlh547;5;This is the second time I've made this delicious and healthy dish. Shared it with a grocery store shopper, said spouse would love it. I did not make any changes to this recipe.
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;beverlyriemer;5;I have been making this recipe for four years now. Delicious! Nothing compares. Simple ingredients. Simply south. Simply Delicious!
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;cookingwithjesus;5;I have never made okra before, but I will be making it again! This was a great recipe. I seem to tweak everything to make it mine, but this is a wonderful recipe to work with! I used fire roasted diced tomatoes, and the stewed tomatoes. I probably added a bit more garlic, a bit less onion, and a bit more green pepper. I love cayenne, too! I just took it to work as a side dish for Shrimp Etouffee that our boss is making. I'll let you know how it was received!
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;eugenesullivan;5;Quick, easy and very delicious!!!
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;mariaharris;2;It is cooking as I am writing this, I only used half of the cayenne, then noticed in the description of the recipe it says crushed red pepper and the recipe says cayenne,big difference, think it would be better with the crushed, I will rate it later
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;cbrown;5;Love it.. I just changed a little I added diced tomatoes (garlic & olive oil) .. taste awesome with cornbread ..
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;cianelima;4;I use fresh okra and did not sliced it .
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;christyyoung;4;We will definitely make this again, with about 1/4 amount of the cayenne called for. This recipe was too hot for us. We added sweet corn and some sugar. It was fantastic.
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;xanyzeidman;3;It was great except too spicy for me! I would tone down the cayenne a lot in the future. I love spicy but this was almost to the point where it was hard to eat without lots of water breaks.
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;sandrakamusikiri;5;Delicious!! The cayenne pepper definitely sets this dish apart from typical okra/ tomato dishes! Like others, I added corn. Thanks for this unique take on a common dish!
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;leigh;3;I cooked two pieces of bacon and removed from pan, sauteed onion and fresh okra in bacon grease then added ingredients (substituted tomatoes for two cans of rotel) and it was perfect! Recipe as is needs some spicing up for my taste.
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;ted100;5;I used fresh okra. Not all cayenne is equally hot, At the lower end of hotness perhaps 1 teaspoon might work ok. My cayenne is toward the higher hotness end, and even 1/2 teaspoon gave a pretty good kick, which was very nice. But anymore and it would have a challenge to enjoy. Very simple and quick recipe. I had a little bit of left over ring sausage that I sliced and threw in there and it was great. Wish I would have had some corn. I love the simplicity of this recipe.
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;joemichaelbaker;5;My mom made it all the time when I was a kid. Always reminds me of summer. My family thought fried was the only way to eat okra but they love this. They have ask for it several times.
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;annmarienatal;5;This recipe is a good way to use okra. Made some really important changes to suite my personal preferences. First of all, the cayenne pepper amount listed here is too intense for me. I cut the amount down to ¼ tsp and added 1 Tbs sugar for a little bit of balance. Fresh okra was also used as opposed to frozen. For those of you worried about the slimy consistency that comes with cooking fresh okra, don’t concern yourself. When cooked, the tomatoes release a liquid which form a sauce that conceal it. I’m not the biggest fan of stewed tomato chunks. I replaced it with two fresh diced tomatoes and blended it with the canned diced tomatoes. Adding ¾ cup of corn not only added a playful color, but some crisp. Season well and cover for the last couple minutes of cooking. This is a nutritious recipe and a nice way to get your veggies in.
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;amina3232;5;Made this recipe tonight. I like it because it used frozen okra and that is usually what I have on hand. I didn't have any cayenne pepper....I used about 1/2 teaspoon of paprika and also crushed red pepper to taste. I had home canned tomatoes...so I used a I quart jar of those and four fresh chopped small tomatoes. I didn't need sugar cause these tomatoes are sweet. I added 1 finely chopped jalapeno. I used 1 1/2 small onion and 4 big cloves of garlic. I added extra bottled hot sauce on top when I ate it and it was awesome!
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;cindycantcook;5;Good recipe. I took advice of others and cut the cayenne in half and it still had plenty of heat. I added a little extra garlic after tasting it halfway through cooking and it added a little more flavor. I couldn't get an 8oz can of diced tomatoes, so I used a 14.5oz size. The few extra tomatoes can't hurt! Will make this again!
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;shonne;5;I added Chipotle Beef Sausage, Fiesta Corn, and mexican style Rotel with Lime and Cilantro. What a winner! My family loved it.
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;bham;5;This is a great recipe! A litttle spicy but very good. I love making a huge pot and then freezing in individual containers to use at a later date.
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;lauraharris;5;My boyfriend and I absolutely love this recipe. I make it exactly as written except that I add a can of tomatoes with jalapenos instead of plain diced tomotoes. It is wonderful and tastes even better the next day, after the flavors have developed and blended more. You won't be disappointed.
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;kissy0303;5;GREAT RECIPE...YUMMY,YUMMY,YUMMY..MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE WITH THE CORN..MY HUSBAND LOVED IT,WILL DEFINATELY MAKE IT AGAIN AND AGAIN....LOVE OKRA..

354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;glynisritter;4;My mother use to make this with her fresh okra and tomatoes. I have made it, too. It is so good with fresh peas and cornbread.
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;susanwalker;4;I would add corn to this. It would taste even better.
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;quiltersammy;4;"Methinks it needs some corn; fresh cut off the cob or frozen. Being of ""southern' heritage......some bacon fat is also a needful addition! Bon appetit ya'll! If the 'sliminess' of the okra bothers you, add a tad of vinegar and it firms-up the okra nicely."
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;melissagoff;4;This was really good. I goobered and was going to make something different when I pulled out my okra, But I had them in the steamer and didn't have the ingriedents I needed for the other recipe..so when searching for an okra and tomato recipe and found this. And I also didn't have bell peppers...go figure. But with not having the bell peppers it didn't stop the recipe. I only added 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper because my kids were eating it, but all in all simple yet delish recipe. Yummy. I had only one child that didn't eat this, but I expected that. But everyone else enjoyed it. TY
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;jodis;5;Great recipe! My family doesn't like too much heat so I replaced the cayenne with tumeric. Also left out the green peppers, which I don't think we missed at all. I didn't have any stewed tomatoes on hand so I used a larger can of diced tomatoes and agree with others that the chunkiness was nice. Also used fresh okra rather than frozen.
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;almondjoy2807;4;This was good. I've made it twice now. The first time around, I loved it. I was tired of my failed attempts at fried okra and wanted to try something new, and this worked out well. My second time around, I made it way too spicy (even with red pepper flakes subbed for the cayenne, since I have kids). The seasoning came out well the first time around, but the second time it was too bland and one-dimensional, aside from the spiciness, I think because of all the canned tomatoes (and I used unseasoned, no salt added ones). Both times I thought it needed some celery to give it some extra flavor, so I will add that in next time. I also think maybe I will ditch the pepper flakes altogether and add in some homemade creole seasoning. It needs more flavor, but definitely not any more heat!
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;danirox;5;this was fantastic! i put half as much cayenne pepper in b/c my tastebuds can't handle too much spice. i made a lot of it and kept in in the refridgerator over the course of a week and it seemed to taste better every time. thanks!!
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;jenniferbishophamm;4;"This is SOOOO good! I've made this twice; once straight from the recipe and once with modifications when I was out of some things: halve the cayenne and use salsa instead of stewed tomatoes. I really preferred it with the salsa and will make it that way from now on. You can make a ton of mods to this and it still turns out great. Thanks for the awesome recipe!!"
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;love2cook;3;I made this with fresh okra instead of frozen, but otherwise followed the recipe at least to the end. When made, I thought the recipe would have been better with about half of the amount of cayenne pepper, as I thought it overwhelmed the balance of flavors. Normally, the stewed tomatoes will add the sweetness, but in this case (because of the cayenne) it needed some sugar. I added almost a TB before thinking it was back in balance. I'll make it again, but will not add all the pepper called for. BTW: One of the reasons I tried this dish was because of the cayenne. I love hot peppers.
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;npace22;5;Didn't think this sounded tasty but I LOVED it! Very good!
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;katiekat;5;I used a full 15 oz can of diced tomatoes by accident, but I ended up loving all the chunks of tomato! I fed this to my husband and mom and they LOVED it.
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;john;5;Five stars because someone else told me it is. I used half the cayenne, which I think is probably enough for most people, but it won't be hot. Used only a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes but threw in some romas from last summers garden to chunk it up. Skipped the green pepper and didn't miss it. This recipe goes well with fish like haddock or tilapia.
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;jfh913;5;This is a great dinner when paired with rice. Our 1 year old daughter loves it too!

I only used diced tomatos and left out the stewed but it was all the same. I also put this over some yellow rice (although the rice was the wrong kind) it turned out really great!
354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;mlcrawfo;5;I use fresh okra and add a pinch of sugar to bring out the natural sweetness in the ingredients. I serve with Tobasco and my husband loves it! Great recipe!

Also added 1/2 cup instant brown rice and 1 cup water to make it a little bit more ""substantial"". Will be great for lunch or as a side dish. Will definitely make again."

354a9791-9741-41c0-8a54-7d7eb5f33357;julia;5;Very good! I would use 1/2 the cayenne pepper next time - a little too hot for our taste.
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;lela;5;My family liked this recipe. It gave crunch to a chicken taco. I added some garlic powder and more lime juice.
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;sheilalalonde;5;This slaw was a great accompaniment to our carnitas tacos. Very fresh and just the right zing for our palates! Thanks for sharing your recipe!
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;craigjones;5;very good on tacos , or by itself will make again
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;carolyn;5;This was a great slaw, which I served along with grilled fish and homemade fries. Switching from mayo based salads is a big deal, and this salad is fresh, crunchy, flavorful. I did not have a jalapeño, so used chopped pickled jalapeños instead. It was also great on day 2.
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;farmerswife;5;Just what I was looking for - flavorful crunch to add to our chicken fajitas!
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;sheila;4;I added extra shredded carrot and some avocado dressing.
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;allrecipesfan;5;So good, give it some time to marinade in the lime juice, enhances it...YUM!
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;miltymann;5;Perfect as written! Thanks.
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;lindajohnson;5;Excellent recipe just as it is written. Love it??
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;annah;5;Delicious, added some salt. Next time may add a little sugar substitute.
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;sushi;5;Loved it exactly as written. I sauted the last serving and it made an excellent hot side dish too
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;amykeating;5;Makes everything better and is so simple. I buy the already chopped slaw with carrots in the produce section, and the whole thing comes together in 5 minutes! Great on tacos or bbq chicken sandwiches or just straight up!
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;jerseywine;5;Fresh and light! Made this for our fish tacos. YUM! Only change I did was I bought the cole slaw mix at the store which had cabbage, red cabbage and carrot already shredded. Gave the tacos a nice light and crunchy texture. Jalapeno gave it a nice kick which we loved.
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;maryjaneharrison;4;"Felt it needed just a little more ""oomph"", though it was fine as is. I think it is a matter of taste. I added garlic and a little more lime juice. Perfect!"
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;paige;5;Yum - No Cilantro for me though
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;gragers;1;It needed something else. Not much flavor
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;bstodg;5;This was a huge hit with my family! Made exactly as written and the leftovers didn't even last 24 hours. We're even making again this weekend.
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;myk;5;I made this with what I had in the fridge so there were a few adjustments: red cabbage & vidalia onion. I kind of did the measurements to what I thought it should look like. Honestly, the recipe gave me just enough direction. The right amount of heat with some crunch (IG: @whatsferdinner)
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;szyq1;3;Made as written and this was OK. Can't put my finger on it, but something is missing. Since I have leftovers of this slaw, I'm hoping as it sits longer it will be better today.
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;maggie;5;I made this recipe as written, and had chicken tacos with leftover rotisserie chicken and soft corn shells that I fried just a little. Topped the slaw with Bolthouse Farms cilantro avocado dressing, and they were the bomb. Better than any restaurant tacos. Also great with grilled fish tacos.
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;ppk;3;Ok as is. Used with the Tuna Lime Tostadas & even put on top of the tostadas which was good also. We'll make again but use little less lime juice & equal parts of sour cream & chili sauce. The sour cream & chili sauce is a recipe we found in an old Joy of Cooking cookbook. I think this will help a lot.
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;james;4;Tasty and necessary for any self respecting fish taco
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;susangleason;4;This is a tasty slaw. I made it last night to accompany roasted cauliflower tacos -- perfect side dish for that. I like the simplicity and freshness of the flavors (onion, jalapeno, lime, cilantro). I added salt, and I think next time I'll add a little cumin too. I added some red cabbage, for more color. Seems like it could become an easy go-to at our house.
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;judyjordan;3;good, followed recipe, family liked it. I thought it was good, but felt it was missing something, may tweak it next time!
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;johnnylove;4;both thumbs up!!
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;dotdot;4;added some cole slaw dressing to make a little more creamy.
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;lutzflcat;4;5.15.18 Enjoyed today with quesadillas and charro beans. Bright, fresh flavor, the perfect dish for any Mexican-themed meal.
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;carrie;5;I made this receipe as written and loved it so did my husband. only thing I did different was buy the coleslaw mixture already shredded. we ate this on ground beef tacos and will be using this over lettuce from here on out.
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;yogwhatup;5;Delicious!!!! I didn't change a thing!
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;chefmo;5;So simple and yet so good! Light and refreshing. It took my fish tacos to another level. Thanks
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;lisadavis;5;I loved how fresh this tasted and the fact there was no mayo or vinegar!
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;ld83;5;I made tacos for dinner tonight but realized that i forgot to buy lettuce too late in the day to run to the store. I knew i had cabbage on hand, so i just searched for a recipe for a Mexican-inspired slaw and i found this gem. Excellent flavor & better than lettuce by far! I will forego lettuce by choice in the future & use this slaw recipe to top my tacos, it's a great idea!
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;ambershults;5;This is an excellent slaw for our favorite fish tacos. Also deliscious with tortilla chips
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;jeffcummings;4;Very good. I thought the slaw itself was a bit sour but it turned out fine with the saltiness of the shrimp and with a little crema drizzled over it. I will definitely make it again.
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;skyview;5;Excellent! I added chicken to the recipe for a main course and my husband loved it. Thank you!
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;mariapedretti;5;You wouldn't think something so simple would have such great flavor but it does! I added this as a topping to brisket tacos and it was perfect- everyone raved about the slaw
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;david;5;Have made alternative slaws like this for years. My favorite version is to add as many veg(bell pep, celery....)as you care to. Add a little more flavor with fresh garlic,sugar, and Siracha instead of the jalapeno. I like to add a small amount of mayo to give it a little creaminess. Good job guys!!!
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;michellerosenthal;4;Really good and easy to make!
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;cynthiatejedamckeever;4;This dish was refreshing and super easy to make. I did not change a thing. We ate it both ways: as a side dish and in the chicken tacos. I will def make it again.
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;jennydiver;5;I made this with the slow cooker pork recipe and I had to make this 3 times in one day since my family loves it so much and every time I turned around, it was gone! I know now to scale the recipe to make more. I made this as written and then made it with about a teaspoon of honey, which I recommend.
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;roser;5;Delish!! We use a half pkg of coleslaw mix in place of the cabbage and carrots in the recipe, and increase the cilantro to about 1/4 cup, and use 2-3 T bottled lime juice instead of fresh. We make soft-floured burritos by putting the slaw on top of Dee's Roast Pork for Tacos (on this sight) and Green Chili Rice (will have to submit the recipe). Love it!
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;christasheehan;4;Not bad. We liked it will be doing it again. Next time we will be adding chicken!
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;stolzs;5;Delicious and healthy. Great on shrimp and chicken tacos. Next time I will just us the coleslaw cabbage mix and add lime onion and jalapeneo
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;hank;5;this is so unbeliavable you will never be able to eat fish tacos out again...............THANK YOU
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;rebeccag;5;YUM! Definite bite, and a great addition to grilled Mahi Mahi tacos, and cilantro serrano lime sauce (also from Allrecipes). Great on wraps and on tacos. This will become a staple mexican food item at our house!
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;careystolzgavaert;5;LOVED this! So easy and very tasty. It is addicting...I ate it with chips and couldn't stop!
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;amb520;5;Fast, easy and tasty. I made it to go with fish tacos and was quite pleased how it turned out. I sliced everything (except the pepper) thin in the food processor and used a Serrano pepper because I prefer the flavour.
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;isabellebrooks;4;I've made this several times to go on fish tacos and it's very good. I've also added a touch of sugar and white vinegar to the lime juice and also added chopped tomatoes. There's alot you can do with this recipe. My husband will eat this alone, but for me that's a bit much.
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;nadiajc;5;Loved it. Refreshing and crunchy on chicken tacos.
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;molly;5;"Great topping for Mexican food. Someone of ""the buzz"" was talking about slaw for Mexican food. I had never heard of such a thing. Well I looked and found this recipe. It is so good and I will probably make it every time I make Mexican food. This would also be good on hot dogs, smoked sausage, hamburgers and sloppy joes. I bought a package of pre-cut slaw and it had the carrots already included, but I added the rest of the ingredients. This was a wonderful topping for ""Mexican Beef Supreme"" on AR. The leftovers were a bit spicier the next day, due to the jalapeños, but it was still wonderful. Thanks mixingmedia for sharing this recipe. This is my 400th recipe made and posted in the year 2011. Happy New Year's eveyone!"
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;robertl6;4;loved it
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;caroljwilson;5;"Perfect just as is, don't change a thing. I'm glad to find this recipe because our favorite Mexican restaurant serves it with tortilla chips. I make this often and everyone raves about it. One thing to point out; it is NOT spicy hot. If you'd rather have it that way just add more jalapenos. But try the recipe as is first."
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;mrscrazyed;5;I've made this several times and have yet to have it as a slaw on tacos. I halve this recipe, add 1/2 small avocado if on hand, and have it for lunch. It's good with or without the avocado. Even DH likes it, which is saying a lot. Eventually I'll try it on tacos. This is definitely a keeper.
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;gingerly88;5;I love this..we eat it all the time now instead of lettuce on our tacos :)
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;pmtz19;5;Let me just start off by saying that it drives me crazy when people rate a recipe but completely change it. If you're rating a recipe, rate it as it was written. With that being said, I give this recipe 5 stars as written. I'm on a diet and so tired of eating plain veggies, so I was looking for something different to do with cabbage and found this recipe. I ate it more like a salad than a topping, but it was so very tasty. Finally, something I can eat guilt free. Thank you for sharing mixingmedias.
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;amandak23k;4;I made this as a side dish to mexican lasagna II from this site, so I added a little oil and white vinegar so it wouldn't be too dry (you wouldn't need it if you were topping tacos with it) I didn't have carrot or red onion so I used red and green pepper along with green onion and I didn't have cilantro. Nice and spicy, gets spicier the longer it sets in the fridge.
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;sarahjo;4;"This was a great base recipe for what I needed for a Take-Out Fake-Out Mexican Dinner. I tossed this with my own ""Fiesta For Your Greens"" dressing and we used this to make mission burritoes. Great way to get your taco take out fix without spending a ton on takeout. NOTE: Because I used my own dressing, I cut back a bit on the lime juice."
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;foodiefamily;4;loved it on my fish taco and pork taco, added tomatoe . yum
0c240d3a-a298-4872-aff4-ef4d53d457d5;glendalee;5;This is simliar to a recipe I use but double the ingredients and add 1 cup of day old cooked rice and a small jar of taco sauce. Yours is great as is so I am giving it 5 stars.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;brewcrew;5;We like kale soups around this household. 1 cup of parsley for garnish seems excessive, but otherwise a fine recipe. We serve with buttered French rolls hot from the oven.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jksfitz;5;"I used 2 bags of fresh chopped kale that I ""massaged"" before adding it to the pot. Basically, I whacked it several times with a wooden mallet while still in the bag. This is meant to help tenderize the kale, and it worked! I also added 3 chopped carrots and, instead of the fresh tomatoes, I used 1 can of diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano, and 1 can of fire roasted diced tomatoes. I included the liquid from the canned beans and therefore used just 32 oz chicken broth. Served with a little parmesan on top. Delish!!!"
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lynnefinch;5;not a huge fan of kale but the bitterness cooks out. tried second time with spinach, not enough flavor. back to kale, and maybe some sausage
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;melissagg;5;I’ve had this recipe for many years saved from a dog eared magazine page. It’s excellent! I normally go heavy on the kale and let it cook in until it’s good and soft then add in the sautéed onion and garlic and tomatoes but that’s my preference.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;noellemayo;5;Always amazing. I add vegan sausage to it because I like it spicy and with added protein. Super easy to make, not a lot of prep and freezes beautifully.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jen;5;Fantastic soup. I have made it exactly as written and also tweaked for my own personal tastes. Sometimes I add vegetarian sausage chopped very small, mushrooms, different beans, etc. I don’t always blend up a can of beans either. I’ll just put in one can of whole beans. This gets rave reviews from everyone I’ve served it to. I make it at least twice a month. Love it! Thank you for the recipe!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;keaton;4;delicious
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;katsly;5;Excellent.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lindapatterson;5;Fast, easy, healthy, wonderful. I added an extra large onion. Also I added a lot of turmeric for all the good things turmeric does. Very tasty. Served with Parmesan and salt
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jenniferm;5;Definitely a keeper!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;clc408;5;I used a package of frozen chopped spinach instead of kale and a can of diced tomatoes with garlic, basil and oregano. It was so easy and quick to make and so delicious.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lowsaltcooker;5;I love this recipe! I bought a mix package of 10 different beans and was looking for soup recipes. I started with this one and added ground turkey, and some leftover cooked rice that I had in the fridge. I didn’t blend the beans. It turned into a hearty meal that we all enjoyed.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;wildbunchmom;5;I halfed this recipe because only my daughter and I will eat kale.... and it is AMAZING!!! I used 1/2 - 2/3 can of diced tomatoes in place of the fresh tomatoes., added a tsp of black pepper, and topped with Parmesan cheese. Another great use for the kale in our garden AND your eating kale, without tasting like you're eating kale. Im going to add nutrientional yeast next time too. Definitely a keeper. Yum!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;tara;5;I absolutely loved this soup! I had, what I considered to be, one serving, but went back for another! I had it for dinner the next day as well. I will make this again.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;puhchooly;5;Super yummy. Kale all sold out to local yogis, so had to use collards. Forgot to grab roma tomatos so had to use normal tomatos. Didn't realize this called for canned beans until I had added the broth, but for all my errors, I'm in love with this soup. Soo Goooood!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;heidifromtheplains;5;My kids gobbled this, my husband gobbled this, and I gobbled this. I used frozen kale (thawed in microwave). And I was careless when reading the directions, so I made a few changes. I drained one can of beans but left the other undrained. I also put both cans of beans in the soup and didn’t put anything in my food processor. But, I do like a bit of cream in soup, so I added 3/4 cup of 1% milk and 1/3 cup cream cheese (mixed in microwave prior to adding it in the soup). Once the cream was added I set the soup to warm until my rolls had finished (about 15 minutes). Even with my mistakes, this soup was delicious.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;elizabethwilliams;5;I used chicken broth with canned tomatoes with garlic basil and oregano in it and had some zucchini squash and yellow squash I needed to used up. Other than that I followed the recipe. I’ve never had kale but my monthly veggie box had it in and I wanted to try it. Great flavor and wonderful aroma as it cooked. Wonderful addition to my soup repertoir
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mfinke1;5;This soup was delicious. After reading all the comments I made the following changes to the ingredients (other ingredients in the recipe were included without change). Used 1c dried beans, soaked overnight and simmered for 2 hrs. Pinch cayenne, 1c chopped carrots, 1c cubed potatoes, 4cloves garlic, 6c Lacinato kale, destalked and cut small, 1 can diced tomatoes and liquid, Italian seasoning, Oregano, fresh rosemary, 1tsp salt, a few grindings of pepper, 1 cup chopped parsley. Everyone loved it and asked for seconds. I particularly liked the addition of beans run through the blender. Made it thicker and creamier. Husband asked for sausage addition next time.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;sanditadeo;5;I made this delicious soup! Followed recipe but had some chicken breast I wanted to use. I boiled the chicken. Method of cooking was fine because the savory sauce from the soup was enough to season the chicken.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lisaengel;5;Didn't blend any ingredients to thicken it just because we wanted a chunky, brothy soup last night. Used vegetable broth and a lot of pepper. It was excellent.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;teriphillipsheppe;5;I missed the info to save some beans for the end. Used a can of chick peas to puree with the broth instead. I also used a dry Tuscan seasoning I had on hand from Wildtree instead of the Italian. The soup was awesome and I'm definitely going to make it again.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;normasorenson;4;I made this exactly to the recipe and it was delicious. Even better the next day.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;melissa;5;I have made this soup literally every Sunday for the past 10 weeks! My husband and I love it! Truly delicious. And I like that my Monday night dinner is already made. I highly recommend this. I make it as the recipe reads, as my culinary skills are limited to just what the recipe tells me to do. But seriously, we love it.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;cindymutdoschtupper;5;This was absolutely fabulous. Only change I made was leaving out tomatoes and replaced with about a third of a carrot, shredded. Wish I would have doubled the recipe. I will be making this again. Maybe tomorrow!! It was that good.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lindahanson;5;Will definitely make this again. Very good and works well with Weight Watchers program.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;eric;5;This was a delicious soup. I mostly followed the recipe, but used light red kidney beans and garbanzo beans. Also added some baby spinach leaves. I will definitely make this one again.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;hoosiermama02;5;I made this twice. First time, with cannellini beans and the second time with great northern. Both times, I used red onion and canned tomatoes (what I had on hand). I tossed in the juice from the tomatoes, added extra basil and topped with Parmesan. Very good!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;calliemulkey;5;This was so good! Didn't have to change anything. Just sprinkled some parmesan on top at the end. So nutritious and healthy, too.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;smallbitesbigworld;4;Quite good and easy to make. I used borlotti beans.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;hastingsgirl;5;Excellent, easy to make soup. Very flavorful & delicious. Probably taste even better the day after, giving the ingredients time to meld.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;michelleleighbees;5;My family loves this soup. I add chicken apple sausage, and cook it all day in a slow cooker. I like the kale very cooked, remove most of the veins from it, and chop it small.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;debbylutestorey;5;My tomatoes may not have been acidic enough, so I added a tin of tomato paste. And served it with lime wedges. I also agree with other reviewers that the soup benefits from longer simmering. But it’s a wonderful and tasty soup!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;catherinereal;4;An outstanding soup. However, be sure to chop the kale finally.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;margaretmatthews;4;Best soup I’ve ever made. It actually one first place in an office soup contest..
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;theresa;5;Love this soup when I'm fasting and it last a long time
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;nancy;5;This is a nice recipe. It is good as is, which is why I rated it a 5-star dish. My son thinks it needs another can of beans so next time I'll add another can . I did cut the kale small and cooked it for a longer time as suggested by other reviewers.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;alexandra;5;Made just as the recipe described and it was delicious, will make again.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;etcm;5;Very good, lots of flavor no need to change anything but could add other vegetables to it easily if you wanted to.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;ginnycostello;5;I made it exactly to the recipe and it was very tasty and filling! I have extra kale so I will make more.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;hollybeauvais;5;Excellent! From reading the reviews, I added chopped carrots and substituted two cans of fire roasted tomatoes instead of fresh. I pureed cannellini beans and put chickpeas in the soup. Used Herbes de Provence instead of Italian. Nom nom!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;suesedgwick;4;I did use a can of diced tomatoes. Thought it was quite good.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;cherylg;5;I have been making this for 2 years and it is one of my go to soups. I use frozen kale instead of fresh, add 1/4 tsp red chili pepper flakes, use one can diced tomatoes instead of the plum tomatoes, add 1 pound smoked sausage (diced), and I do not purée anything. I like that I have the ingredients on hand most of the time, it has minimal prep, one pot, and a short cooking time.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;ladybug;5;I chose this because of the ingredients, I had chopped and frozen kale in my freezer and couldn’t drink another smoothie! I was pleasantly surprised to absolutely love every single spoonful! It was amazing!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kathytanner;5;It was delicious!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;audreymillertoney;5;Great soup. I used more kale and broth than it called for, and was generous with the seasonings. I'd make it again.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;emergingsynergy;5;I've made this a half-dozen times or more. I generally follow the recipe. It always turns out great. I always wish I made more for the freezer.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;springinspea;4;I’d use less onion, and much more kale. I think I’d also add potatoes and carrots to make it a bit more heartier.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;irenewilliams;5;Great with some cauliflower and carrots thrown in as well!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;raheem;5;I made this and it came out great. I added kielbasa to mine.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;deniseray;5;My family loved this soup. The only change i made was using canned garlic, oregano seasoned tomatoes instead of fresh.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;aliskerre;5;awesome
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;thekingschild;2;I made it and didn't care for it at all. That said, I did substitute lentils for the beans.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;blb1319;5;I have made this soup many times. It comes together so quickly. Very tasty! I use whatever tomatoes I have on hand and I have never added the parsley.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;carolewallshenry;4;Really tasty. I didn’t have any kale on hand so I substituted rainbow chard.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;sandy;5;Love this recipe! I make it all the time. I add chicken sausage, spinach and white rice. Sooooo good!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;robertrhea;5;very healthy and hearty
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mel;4;Added lentils instead of beans and it was awesome ! Before I added water N cheicken stock I sautéed wverything in a pan.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;susanhow;5;This is a fantastic recipe as written. I used a famous-brand pressure cooker and added a package of ground Italian sausage. I sautéed it for a bit and then added the chopped onion and garlic for the last couple of minutes. Add the rest of the ingredients, set 10 minutes on the pressure cook setting, and quick release afterward. No added liquid - just use the liquid in the recipe. Blending the beans at the end is key - it gives the soup some body. I prefer cannellini beans over navy, and I use any old can of diced tomatoes that I have in my pantry.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;tanya;3;I made this souo cause I had to get on a special diet for health reasons. It’s very limited so I tried this soup. To be honest it wasn’t my favorite but I am adjusting to big dietary changes so that is probably just my lifestyle change. Overall it was not bad. My husband ate it and liked it and I ate more the next day. It gets better in flavor The next day. I did add a few chopped cherry tomatoes while cooking just for a little color and it helped the flavor. I will make it again.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;valerie;5;Very good & hearty soup. Cubed butternut squash is a yummy addition. I also added a tablespoon of lavender white wine vinegar at the end. This is my go-to kale soup recipe now!

e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;janemayer;5;Great recipe! I had northern white beans cooked and frozen so I used them instead and just added more broth. I also added sage and green pepper, with a pinch of cayenne. Great on a cold night after a week of flu in the household.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;retrorose;5;Followed the recipe to a T. Chopped my kale small. Will definately make again.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;enidfashionjunkeemcdonald;5;Great recipe!! Well seasoned and quick!!! FOOTBALL SUNDAY!!!! It was a hit!!! A keeper!!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;weavermm;5;Wonderful.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;daviddegarmo;4;I think this is a real good recipe as written. I made some slight modifications based on personal preference. I withheld the beans until the kale was cooked. After 15 minutes I thought it was still way too chewy, so I cooked it another 15 minutes, then added the beans and puree and cooked it another 10. I also thought 8 cloves of garlic sounded like too much so I only used 4, again just my preference. Thank you for this good vegetarian version of Bean and Kale soup. It's a keeper.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;shortbaker;5;This was wonderfully easy. I added leftover roasted chicken and had to use 1 Tb of basil and 1 Tb of oregano, did not have Italian seasoning. Makes a lot, we are freezing half for later!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;rubies481;2;I thought this was so so. Italian herb seasoning was weird.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;susieq;5;I did add a few things-1/2 lb mild Italian sausage, a pinch of fresh Rosemary and Thyme and a 1/4 cup sweet red wine to sweeten the tomatoes. I topped mine with scallions and jalapenos and served with toasted seasoned bread. Yum. Hubby loved it!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;minna;5;Great recipe! I use low sodium chicken broth and beans to reduce the sodium content.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;debdonaldson;5;I had more kale to cook and added some celery, but really enjoyed this recipe.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;marysch;5;Yummy & very easy
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;silent;5;My entire family, ranging from 7-33, adored this soup. It was incredibly savory, and just yum. Highly recommend.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;janefrazeeweaver;4;This was yummy. I would love to know nutritional values though
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;violetbeattie;5;So good!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lindaeaves;5;I made this tonight & followed the recipe exactly. I had no idea it would taste so good because there really aren’t many ingredients, but we were happily surprised. I’m always looking for different ways to use kale & wow, this recipe hit the spot! I made a pot of jasmine rice to add to the soup if anyone wished. With or without rice this soup is tasty & deserves 5 + stars!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;foodies34;3;It’s good but I’m not sure if I’ll make it again. I make a lot of stews and soups, and while I love the combination it seems to lack something, not sure what. The red pepper as other suggested helped it out!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;sandyjacobsen;4;I added ground chicken. Very good.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;sosharon;5;This is very good! I added one diced yellow pepper and sautéed shallots instead of yellow onion because I needed to use them up. I pureed one can of beans and used the other in the soup. I also squeezed juice from half of a lemon after the soup was heated through. Definitely fine chop the kale so that it presents in edible bites with each spoonful! This would be a nice replacement for chicken soup when you're felling under the weather. Tastes even better the second day!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;aristotle;5;Needed something cheap and easy. This was a great solution. I followed the directions almost exactly. I used cherry tomatoes instead of plum tomatoes, ensuring that I sliced them three ways. For extra protein, I finely chopped half of a baked boneless chicken breast I had laying around. For the broth I used two cups of chicken broth and two cups of vegetable broth. Very easy to make, very tasty. Two thumbs up.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;barbn;5;Love this as is, also with Parmesan rind simmered in, and a bit of smoked ham or pork for a non-veg version. Wonderful, yummy flavors!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kimthomas;5;I really liked this soup! Made it as written except I added shredded poached chicken, and used the homemade broth for the recipe. Hubby hated the kale but I loved it. I think it might hav been better if I had cut or torn the kale into smaller pieces. You could always use spinach instead. I will make it again!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;bigal;5;This soup was AWESOME
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;simplyrawesome;5;"This recipe is my absolute favorite soup recipe! Whenever I make it for potlucks or bring it to a dinner or other event, everyone asks for the recipe. When I make it just for my husband and myself, there's never any leftovers. We can't stop eating it until it's all gone!! It's so warming and comforting. It's especially good on a cold winter day. This recipe is perfect as is, but for a little extra kick, I add a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis (Original) and about a 1/2 TBSP of Tony Cachere's Creole Seasoning. Oh, I also add a bit of Turmeric too. I've been making this for a few years; can't believe I haven't reviewed it before now! YUMMMMMMMM!!!!!"
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;citybluesgirl;5;Very good soup. It is quite filling.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;annmarierivera;5;I liked it a lot, i used minced garlic, northern beans and 5 cups of kale. I let it cook a little longer. It is actually tastes good.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;beckynorman;4;We scaled back on the garlic, but everything else was perfect. Very tasty meal - especially with Red Lobster cheese buns as a complement!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;briandonovan;5;Great recipe that both the wife and I enjoy. I would cut the garlic by half, unless you really love garlic and the parsley justs seems redundant with all that kale.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;carolmarie;4;Used fresh kale, cherry tomatoes, parsley, basil, & rosemary from my garden, & vegetable broth. Blended rosemary & basil with beans & broth in blender. Pretty good!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kris;4;Made the soup exactly per the recipe. It was excellent. One thing I will do next time is to use a cup or two more kale.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;anneschenk;5;I love this recipe because it's simple yet full of flavor. I let the onions cook a bit before adding the garlic. I find adding garlic too soon results in it burning. I also add some chicken meat from a rotisserie chicken for extra protein and flavor. And a sprinkle of grated parmesan or romano when served adds another tangy layer of flavor.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lizlentis;5;Delicious! Followed as is (except cooked longer) and added additional basil, oregano & thyme.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kwintle08;5;Made this last night for the first time. Didn't have 2 cans of white beans...subbed one can of Kidney beans. Just added 1 big farmstand tomato, didn't puree other can of beans...husband said it would be good too if I added chicken sausage....
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;scott;5;This soup was super easy and tasted fantastic. My whole family loves it, including my 3 year old and 5 year old (I'm always looking to increase the veggie intake with my kids and this is a great way to do that).
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;linda;4;Soup flavor is amazing ... I used a can of stewed tomatoes and I wish I had chopped my kale a little smaller. Always looking for new soup recipes and this one I'm sure will become a repeat
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lonhause;5;This is my third time making this. This time I decided to add some leftover chorizo sausage and it really gave it a nice twist in flavor.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;ray;4;Added some more spices, a splash of heavy cream, and some chickpeas. Two thumbs up
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;davidckeeling;5;Used 14oz. Can of diced tomatoes and green chilies in place of Chopped tomatoes, added two uncooked chicken breasts before soup simmered.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mongo274;5;"Turned out much better than I expected. I used a mixture of kale, baby spinach and collard greens ""superfood mix"" from Costco."
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;hilary;5;Oh, my! Light, fresh, pungent flavors make for a new favorite for this soup-o-phile! I did swap out the kale for fresh dandelion greens (remove the leaf rib to cut down on bitterness), and generously drizzled fresh squeezed lemon on individual servings. Perfection!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lou;5;GREAT soup!!! I LOVE it. I am going to make batches of it and refrigerate in glass jars. Easy to prepare and TASTY! I used a food processor to chop up the ingredients, and added a little extra salt and pepper. Top it off with some grated Parm cheese if you wish. A tasty, healthy soup. :-)
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kicky4200;4;"Made it exactly following the recipe...turned out very good. I used Cannelinni beans and my husband (who is not a ""bean person"" nor a ""kale person"") really liked it. I'll definitely make it again."
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mortaric;4;Very nice. Next time I would skip the parsley, maybe rinse the beans to reduce the sodium, and chop the kale a little more fine. I'll definetally make it again.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;dorothyclayburn;5;I love the white bean and Kale soup...it is yummy and sooooo easy to make...I did use baby Kale, which works well, easier to chop and the stems are not as intense as it would be in regular kale..I did simmer longer and did not use quite as much garlic and I did use a can of organic diced tomatoes...a easy make for a quick soup...love the flavors of it all.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;bartjasiewicz;5;Added some crushed red pepper for a bit of heat, otherwise made as written. Final product was delicious
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jenniferd;5;I absolutely loved this. I did add some carrots and red bell pepper. I also threw in a bay leaf. But it is absolutely delicious. I will make it over and over again, I am sure! My vegetarian son loved it as well.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;aarti;4;I made this recipe with I can of white kidney beans and one can of black beans and it worked great. It was a lot of soup for one person so next time I would only make half of it.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;margieneehiniaani;5;Excellent Recipe. I added Carrots and Potatoes and an extra can of beans and this turned out Phenomenally!!! LOVE IT
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;rose;5;This is delish!!!!!! I did not make any substitutions. However, I chopped my kale a little bit smaller as per other reviews. Very filling and tasty! Wil be making this again and again! Thank you for posting this recipe!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mrwhiskers;5;Delicious and super easy!! I added 1/2 cup red wine, (1) 28 ox can diced tomatoes, 1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes, some red pepper flakes, 1 1/2 large white onions, 10 cloves garlic, blended in a food processor. I sprinkled cheddar on top, and will add sausage next time,
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;paula;4;Fast to make and taste really good!

e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;michael;5;Fantastic recipe. I added a few strips of bacon, which was excellent.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;hansmooy;5;"Great hearty soup!!...I added another can of beans to the blender mixture and simmered 20 minutes with lid off and then on for 20 more...I will make again, my 5 year old has named this ""daddy's soup"". And is now his favorite, (this week!)...ha!"
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;aprill;5;Healthy and tasty! Everyone in our family loved it, including 2 year old)
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;stellawray;5;This is one of five favorite recipes I found on this site.. It is a ten star recipe! It fits all dietary purposes. The only thing we tweaked was adding a bit of fresh lemon juice to it at the end. Thank you for sharing.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;estanford;5;I loved this recipe. I added about a tablespoon of cumin, a little extra chicken broth, and some rotisserie chicken. It's a great hearty, and savory soup.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;catlady;4;I had some Lacianto Kale which I needed to use and wanted to make soup. Be sure to remove most of the stems unless you are using baby kale because the stems will be to tough for this cooking time. Also you can use canned diced tomato if you have a brand that doesn't taste like cans. I make a soup just like this with escarole which is really good. Because the kale is stronger, I used half the amount. I also added some cooked pasta and topped it with Parmesan. Kids ate it up - no leftovers!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;chefv;4;This is very tasty.. And better yet healthy! I couldn't bring myself to use 8 cloves of garlic, so I used 4. I also added a rib of celery and 1 Carrot diced to the onion. I took the suggestions of others and made sure to chop my kale very fine.. And cooked it down for a good 10 minutes. I used equal parts of dried oregano, Basil, garlic powder and parsley in place of the Italian seasoning. I simmered mine for 20 minutes on low uncovered and then shut off stove and let it sit there before I ate it, (about 15 mins). Salt and peppered to my own taste. Make sure to use a no salt added bean. I'd make again for maybe adding some leftover roast chicken for a heartier meal.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lock;5;Awesome. I added fresh basil, fresh rosemary, and oregano. Love it and cheap to make.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;pate;4;Made is shown and even my 93 year old Mother gave it a thumbs up. She is like Mikey from the commercial if you remember it...................never likes anything.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;angcar;5;I followed this recipe except cooking it longer! Great recipe will definitely make again! Thanks!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jobice;5;I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and chopped the kale into small bits. We liked the thickening that the last step adds (pureeing half of the beans with some broth). I used a can of diced tomatoes in place of fresh, and we sprinkled a bit of parmesan cheese onto the bowl of soup. I'm all about one-dish meals ( and my husband doesn't consider it a meal if there's no meat), so I tried adding some ground beef. I sauteed it and drained the fat before adding the garlic and onions to the pan. It was delicious. Next time I will try cutting up some chicken sausage or turkey kielbasa into the soup. Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jacquelinerahn;5;I loved it! The puree of the bean made it so creamy. I used Vogel vegetable bouillon and a bit of white wine vinegar. I forgot the parsley. I'll add a picture of my next bowl.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;george;5;I made SIGNIFICANT modifications to this recipe out-of-the-gate just because I had things I wanted to throw in, and it came out FABULOUS. That is a testament to the versatility of this recipe and soups in general. I had a LOT of kale, so I doubled that. I sliced up a pound of sweet Italian sausage and browned it on high heat in a skillet, then through that in. I used dried beans instead of canned (so that took a few hours in advance to hydrate). Dried beans will lower the sodium level of any dish significantly (over canned beans). I used dried parsely because I had a ton. I put in more onion (because you can never use too much onion in any dish). I skipped the whole part with processing the beans to thicken. It seemed unnecessary and I realized I put ALL the beans in before I read that I was to hold some beans out for processing. Oh well. Lastly, I just added as much broth as I wanted to get it to the consistency I wished. It was GLORIOUS! This is a complete meal and about as healthy as it gets.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kathysmall;5;I used garbanzo beans since that was what I had in my pantry. It was delicious!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lindseygraf;5;Great flavor and easy preparation. The leftovers tasted just as good and we actually finished them which is rare.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;familygal;5;"(rating for recipe, not for my non-conformist soup) I didn't follow directions, thus: mine was too salty; I didn't use the low salt broth, I also used can tomatoes which has salt, next time only fresh tomatoes. My whole family loved this. The kale did turn a bit black several hours after making it. Perhaps I did something wrong there. But even my non-vege picky eaters liked the taste!"
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;stephanielholt;5;I loved this recipe. Since I doubled it the longer the leftovers the better it got. I used vegetable broth, added Bay Leaf and extra garlic. I will definitely make this again. I'll maybe trying adding potatoes and extra tomatoes.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kellydb;2;It had very little flavor was extremely bland!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;bewilderednconfused;5;I used diced tomatoes as they were on hand, otherwise didn’t change anything. Delicious! I make it frequently.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;christinejefferson;5;Quick and delicious soup that I don't feel guilty having seconds. Try adding Spicy chicken sausage to make it more hearty. I've made this several times. Love it.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;harvesttime55;5;Excellent soup! Used the food processor for the kale, chopped onions, and chopped tomatoes. Love the way it tastes and smells.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;ginaguerra;5;I LOVE this soup!! It's simple, tasty, and makes a great lunch or dinner on a cold day.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;robertedwardlake;4;I would double this for our family and serve it with bread. Also, do not add the garlic to the pan until after the onion has turned brown and then just for a couple of minutes. You may also substitute a 14oz. can of diced tomatoes for the plum tomatoes. Everything else was very good and flavorful.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;keltont;5;I added in lentils and white beans and mixed in purple cabbage as well as mrs. dash and cajun seasoning and it gave it a warm taste!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;marshaparksbroadaway;5;Loved this! I did make a few changes, after reading reviews. I added potato, carrots, and zucchini to bulk up the vegetables and adjusted the herbs to my own taste. Will make this again!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;davenivison;5;Absolutely delicious. I like to add smoked pork or ham.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mariab;5;I am rating the recipe with my additions: I sautéed some chopped ham, added onion, carrot and celery, then kale, then chicken broth. I had dried beans that I soaked and added. Used canned tomatoes. Added garlic and seasoning. Delicious!!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jonthomas;4;Great recipe! I don't usually do well on first attempts at new recipes, but this came out surprisingly well. This was actually pretty easy to pull off, and by all accounts Kale is incredibly healthy for you. A variation I've since tried is to use two cans of cannellini beans in the soup itself, and blend at least half a can or more into the remaining chicken broth before pouring it in. It thickens the soup a little more, which is how I like it. If that's not your thing, the existing recipe is good too.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;poodatkat;2;I followed the recipe exactly with veggie broth and it tasted like the seasonings were off and not well rounded. Too herby. Maybe it would have helped if I reduced the oregano and added some white wine.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;marybmagneson;5;Delicious, I used a whole can canned diced tomatoes since I didn't have plum.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jerrytrotter;4;great soup. I added Swiss chard, Yukon gold potatoes, and red pepper flakes to spice up the soup. I also cooked 1 cup of dried beans instead of the 2 can beans., then, I blended one can of the cannellini beans as suggested. It turned out great!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;nicole;3;I was not impressed with this soup but my husband loves it-and I'm happy to oblige if he'll eat all this kale! The only thing I added was 5 medium sized carrots, chopped, and then I made sure to up the broth, and added one more can of beans. My husband loved this with fresh parsley and a heaping 2 tbsp of Parmesan cheese in his bowl. We will be making this again this winter!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;dretta;5;Always looking for good soups with greens and this soup is absolutely delicious! I took it to a dinner and both young and old loved it. I would recommend, as others have, chopping the kale into very small pieces. (The only change I made was to omit the oil as we are on the Prevent & Reverse Heart Disease plan.)
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kathleenisabell;3;"The general flavor and presentation of the soup is wonderful. My chief criticism is that the kale is not cooked. Being unfamiliar with kale, I didn't realize that ""wilting"" it does not make it tender. I thought I was eating lawn weeds! I simmered the soup for 15 minutes to cook the kale and make it tender. Also, I think 4 cups is far too much kale. Next time I will use half as much, and steam it beforehand. I substituted canned diced tomatoes for the plum tomatoes, and also cooked dry Great Northern beans instead of using canned beans. I added extra broth and water to fill out the liquid called for. I think you could also do well with cut carrots in place of the tomatoes in this nice soup, and add a little rosemary."
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;trishwatkins;4;I added more kale since I had a ton from the garden! I have made it on the stove top and in the slow cooker and it was great both ways. It freezes really well and tastes just as good when thawed out months later. Definitely on my go to soup list. Thank you!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;carinetorrance;5;the whole family loved it and i added sweet potatoes and some leftovers pork roast .Also i used dry navy beans(i hate canned goods).i just boiled them for about 2 hours with salt and used them instead of the canned beans.Nest time i will make cornbread to go with it.delicious..............
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;runeat;5;Loved it! I added some diced ham and so did not add salt. Easy and wonderful!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;aisingularity;3;I liked Chef John's beans and greens better.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;court220h;5;Used canned diced tomatoes, added carrots & celery, subbed 1 can of garbanzo beans because that's what I had. Yummy on a cold winter night!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kabee;5;I did not expect this to be so good. Only made it to use up older kale. Did not change anything except I didn't have low sodium broth so I used a can of low sodium tomatoes and did not add salt. It was excellent.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;julieyoung;5;I have a rich Italian heritage and one of my favorite Italian meals is pasta fazoli. I made this recipe and added some elbow macaroni I had in my cupboard and the meal tasted much like a well done fazoli. Plus it
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;rachel;3;I blew it - thought I'd be clever and use dried beans. Despite soaking overnight, they were not tender even after cooking for an hour. Plan accordingly. I think it would have been 4 stars if the beans were tender.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;adreanabrochu;5;Turned out so good! I was hesitant at first due to what I felt was a lack of ingredients this is the first soup I have ever made and it was delicious. I cooked it in the Dutch oven and was pleasantly surprised! It is very flavourful
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;erickaschelstraetesavage;5;"This soup was delicious but I did make some changes to it. Normally I follow recipes to the letter due to the fact that I'm not a very good cook and not creative enough, in the kitchen, to substitute ingredients; however, based on others' reviews I made the following changes. I added mild Italian sausage - removing the casings and sliced in small chunks. I sautéed the sausage in the oil first then added the onion and garlic. I also ended up using 4 large, 2 medium and 2 small garlic cloves which worked out perfectly fine. While I tend to be a huge garlic lover I think 8 large cloves would have been too much, even for me. I, also, did not do the bean puree as I tend to like brothy soups. I did drain the beans but didn't rinse them. Since I added sausage and drained the beans I ended up using 4 cups of chicken broth. Also, I let the soup simmer for 30 minutes as the kale was still a bit too chewy at 15 minutes. This soup turned out fantastic and, I believe, would be great even without the sausage."
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;joanmchardy;5;Wanting a healthy start to the new year,I was looking for a satisfying and healthy lunch time soup to make. This did not disappoint. I did alter the recipe slightly by reducing the amount of beans and increasing the kale. Also used a can of plum tomatoes instead of fresh and a good amount of black pepper but apart from that everything was as is. Really hearty and delicious soup. Served it with an open salad sandwich with very seedy whole grain bread. Will certainly be adding this one to my regular makes.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;carajohnston;4;Looking for different ways to eat Kale. (I've exhausted Kale Chips.) We liked this soup! I added Turkey Sausage links. I don't know if we would have liked it so much without the sausage. I also added some shredded carrots. Yum!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;ov29;5;Delicious recipe! I did, however, make a few little tweaks--I added in cubed red skin potatoes instead of blending the broth and bean mixture, and I found that while this didn't thicken the soup, which I wasn't really after, it did add a bit of heartiness to the soup. I also added extra italian herbs (Mrs. Dash never fails me) and it only made it better in terms of taste and fragrance. Of course, this depends on your preference. Thank you for sharing the awesome recipe!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;sara;5;So delicious, I used kidney and black beans and forgot to prep the vegetable stock before hand but the cubes dissolved well with lots of stirring.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mrsd0480;3;As is, worth 3 stars. The soup was actually tasty but we both felt there was way too much Italian seasoning taste. If tomatoes aren't at their peak, use a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes. I will also add some sausage next time to amp up the flavor a bit more. If you have time, let soup simmer for much longer to allow the flavors to come together even more. Overall, a good base that can be tweaked to your liking.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;tempo124;4;This was a good base recipe. Make sure you simmer it long enough to really cook the kale, otherwise it will be chewy. Make sure you taste as it cooks to punch up seasonings to your liking. I ended up adding quite a bit more salt, pepper, and some chicken bouillon powder (in addition to the chicken broth). I still thought it was a little bland, so I wanted to add crushed red pepper flakes. Didn't have any on hand, so added some ground cayenne (about 2 teaspoons). The final product was very yummy. I didn't care for the parsley garnish, but no problem to just leave that off. Will probably make this again since it is a healthy filling dinner for two, plus a bit of leftovers for the next day's lunch.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;q8;5;Great recipe as is! Sometimes I add Cajun sausage and enjoy that too. Served with corn bread, yum!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;christinemiali;3;The broth was really good, but in the end it was missing something.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mimismith;3;I followed the recipe to the T and it was not very filling. Too much garlic for me.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;annienielsen;4;It looked good as written but I made some subs (frozen kale for fresh) and omitted tomatoes (food issues with one family member). Very tasty and I'll continue to make this over and over.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lfine;5;I have to give 5 Stars to this one, I've been making this for a couple of years and we love it. I can tomatoes in the summer so I use a quart jar of my own and I always add a little extra garlic to it, I think the garlic is what makes it have that special kick for me but, for those who don't like garlic you might try using a little garlic powder and it would not be as garlicky. It's really great with a side salad and a fresh warm cornbread or warm Baguette and butter. Yum!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jmoore;4;Adding shredded chicken did a lot to make this soup more hearty!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;sarahtennessee;5;Fabulous. I didn't change a thing, except I think it is better without the parsley on top. :-)
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kaydlove;5;Awesome! I changed it all and it was restaurant worthy! I started with a pound of local sweet Italian sausage. Then I added a large onion, all the garlic and eventually 6-8 cups of kale. Wilt the kale good! Then I added 6-8 Roma tomatoes, 7-8 cups of broth, Italian seasoning, two cans of white beans and one can pureed. Amazing!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jodibuchholtz;5;"love this soup. I did some changes to the recipe. Instead of plum tomatoes, I used a can of petite chopped tomatoes; I added fresh sliced mushrooms the last 5 minutes; also added some chopped linguisa sausage to the sauteed onion and garlic. Delicious!!"
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jenifer;5;Super!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;justme;5;Just great! I didn't have any white beans, so I used black beans instead. Everything else I followed as outlined. It tasted clean and fresh. Good as is or use as a base for a heartier soup by adding other veggies. It can stand on its own though.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;athena;5;I was lazy and skipped the blending step, and it was still a very delicious soup! We had some left over tri-tip steak and decided to through it in at the last minute. Either way, meatless or veggie, this soup is excellent!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;ruthbridges;5;This is a tasty bean soup, I will definitely make it again! I agree with some other commenters that the kale should be chopped fine. My mistake was not reserving beans and broth to puree, so removed about 1/3 of the soup and pureed that. Otherwise I made it to the letter and everyone loved it! Oh yes, added baby carrots since the patch was just thinned :)
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mar924;4;I'm not a big fan of kale, but my brother-in-law gave me some from his garden so I decided to make a soup. It was actually very good. The only change I made was to use 1 can of diced tomatoes instead of the fresh.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;tameraharris;4;This soup was very good. I used canned great northern beans the first time but the second time I used the bagged kind (soaked first). Also, the second time I skipped the food processor and my husband and I like the second batch best. Both times I boiled smoked turkey necks to add flavor and it was very very good
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;shannon;4;This is one fantastic dish!! It has such crisp freshness while delivering tons of flavor .. I did alter two ingredients and added one .. I only used 6 cloves of garlic and I used a can of diced tomatoes w/green chilies vs. the plum tomatoes .. I also added spicy Italian ground sausage for extra protein and a kick .. Yum ~ I can't wait to have it again tomorrow!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;wendyk;5;This is so good and flavorful! It's the first time I have used kale. I used the ingredients I had on hand, kidney beans, cherry tomatoes, instead of the ones listed and added a few more veggies I needed to use up. I will make this soup again! Thanks for sharing the recipe!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;donnellyk;5;Fantastic, added chunks of Italian sausage and a few good sprinkles of crushed red pepper flakes, yum!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;dkjensen;5;Add spicy sausage
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;spudbuddies;5;Delicious! Many of the pictures appear to have carrot in the soup, so I sliced one thinly and added it. Excellent recipe! My second bowl included a sprinkling of parm on top, which I recommend highly. Wow!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;evadeleon;4;Hearty and healthy!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;moniquee;4;Followed the recipe exactly as written. It was definitely a hit in my house. The leftovers the following day were even better.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;daniella;4;Love this recipe! Its simple and fast and its a super tasty way to incorporate beans and kale into our diet. I used dry beans - just boiled them beforehand.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lauriesuekolau;5;Made this last night and I wasn't sure how it would come out. It is delicious! Having it for lunch and probably again for dinner. I bought two big bunches of Kale and it shrunk nicely. I used 2 cans of stewed tomatoes instead of fresh (drained and cut) and also threw in 6 carrots since I have lots on hand and also an extra can of chicken broth. I'm loving these kale soup recipes and this one is on my favorite list!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;davidbelais;5;I add a quarter cup of lime juice and 2 teaspoons of sugar :-)
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mrb;4;great dish, I boiled a skinless chicken breast for 20 minutes, shredded it then added it to the soup along with the blended beans. Very tasty and fulfilling.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;juliepinson;5;Loved this!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mark;5;A great soup ! Only thing I added was mushrooms. The whole family loved it.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;pbruveris;5;This is really good. I don't post reviews very often, but this is definately worth making. I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh and frozen chopped kale instead of fresh, these changes made it even easier to make.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;catw;5;Very good. I used 1 can cannellini beans, 1 can kidney beans and 1 can black beans, all low sodium. Also added about 3/4 lb. of ground chicken and substituted herbs de provence for the italian seasoning.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lelahsmom;5;I started with a rotisserie chicken carcass and made my own chicken broth then added the meat off the bone. Then proceeded with the soup as the recipe is written. Very good!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;ebony;5;First off,I loved this recipe. I added a few of my own touches to it but, followed the basic steps. I diced and cooked up two chicken breast and, because I'm a tomato lover I used a can of Italian style stewed tomatoes instead of the plum tomatoes. For the thickening sauce I used a third can of beans mixed with another can of Italian style stewed tomatoes and, the remaining amount of my broth...it came out perfect...it was just what I needed for the cold Michigan weather..
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jeannemaler;5;Delicious!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;hollyhaffmuchnok;5;Fantastic soup met rave reviews! Minor personal tweaks: added some rainbow swiss chard & about a 1/2lb of sweet bulk sausage. Sub: 26oz box of POMI chopped tomato since I didn't have the fresh plum tomato. GREAT FLAVOR - ready for leftovers!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;emilyalimonos;5;Sooo delicious. The only change I made was I used less garlic, about 4 cloves, and added 3 carrots and about 1 cup of broccoli. Also I added a few dashes of red pepper flakes. Super healthy, beautiful and delicious.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;golfergirl;5;The key to kale having a nicer texture is to massage it (seriously....google it..haha) about five minutes before preparing the recipe. Other than that, I followed Marim's tip and used a little extra garlic and a small can of diced tomatoes in place of the plum tomatoes. YUM!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jennifer;5;Wanting to extend my palate, I bought kale for the first time and made this soup. It was awesome and is a new favourite. Unfortunately, I did run into some kinks and had to make the following modifications based on what I had on hand: just 1 can of beans, medium chunky salsa plus some ketchup instead of tomatoes. In the future, I'll use more bean as well as fresh tomatoes (and no ketchup). I expect to still add salsa though as I liked how spicy it was with that addition.

e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;gurlcbl;5;Loved it! I subbed chopped carrots for the tomatoes, next time I'll add both. Great with some Parmesan grated on top. Thanks for the delicious recipe!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;renatarosenblatt;5;Do yourself a favor and add the cayenne pepper at the end as someone suggested. The soup was good but the Cayenne pepper gave it that special kick. I would've never expected for it to make such a profound difference. I also put a parmesan rind in the soup and didnt blend it because I was too lazy. Will make it again.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;marialarosa;5;Love this soup!! I didn't have any plum tomatoes so I substitutted with a 28 oz. can of crushed plum tomatoes and it worked out great!! Also, didn't have fresh parsley so I used about half cup of dried parsley. Soup was delicious!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;steve;5;This soup was super easy to make and amazingly tasty! I can't wait to eat leftovers. I think I'm going to free some too
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kate;4;I changed this recipe by using yellow plum tomatoes. I also used red leaf lettuce in place of kale. I added a few chopped radishes and some snap peas about 5 minutes before finishing. After tasting I added some cayenne pepper and it blended well.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;yenmo;5;Great Recipe. I used 2 cans of tomatoes instead of fresh. One spicy, one regular. It was really good!! My kids even liked it. I would chop the kale pretty small. Big pieces can be tough, even after simmering for 30 minutes.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;dealrup;5;Super delicious! Great go to soup for cold days. I used 1 tlb of herbs de provence for herb blend. Everything else I did as directed. Very good!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;beth;5;A great soup, especially with a pound of ground hamburger cooked in Italian seasonings added to the mix.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;patbarkeralmond;5;Very good soup! The kale needs to be chopped and I added parmesan cheese when serving...yummy!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;cowgirll;5;Filling and easy - a great winter dinner with some crusty bread.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;donna;5;My family ate it and fought over who was taking the leftovers for lunch. Didn't have tomatoes so used seasoned petite diced can tomatoes. Also cooked longer then the time specified to make sure the kale was tender. Also drained the beans don't like to use that juice in the can.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;squarepeg;5;Very tasty. Made the recipe exactly as described. Next time I will cut up the kale into smaller pieces though.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;oonachiu;5;They are yummy. I love this recipe using fresh tomatoes instead of can tomatoes. My husband and my eight months old baby love this soup. Gonna make it again soon.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;callista;5;I took this recipe and used it liberally. I had dried black beans on hand which I boiled in slightly salty water until done. In another pan, I sauteed some italian sausage and garlic. Then I added a quart of chicken broth, leftover cabbage, carrots, some potatoes, chopped hot peppers and cooked til potatoes and carrots were soft. Simple, cheap, healthy.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;tanya;5;This is so good. I made half a batch and threw in some carrots and zucchini on top of everything else. Also used canned tomatoes (no fresh in the house).
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;coreo;5;Super good! Added tons of veggies... great for a cold drizzly weeknight.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;shannonrichey;3;The pot I used was maybe 4 qt. in size. The quantity of kale in this recipe would be better suited for a large, large, large pot unless you really like kale. I spent an hour de-kale-ing the soup. For a 4 qt. pot I used maybe 1.5 cup of kale. Other than that, it was good. Next time I'll just put in a bit of tomato paste for flavor, as I don't like chunks of tomatoes. I would also put in 3 cans of beans over 2. But good flavor to this. Added turmeric powder for depth of color and flavor.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;michellerl;5;Have made this several times - so easy and delicious!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jeanne;4;even better then I imagined. worth using my food processor.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;patmc102;5;It was delicious ! Used canned tomatoes since I did not have plum tomatoes on hand. Everything else followed as written.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;joannevoorhees;5;Great soup for the winter season..
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mjmosher;5;A Co-worker made this and it was delicious! I just made it myself today. I added baby bella mushrooms this time. The flavor is unbelievable!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;debbie;5;AWESOME!!!!!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;debc;4;I added some shredded chicken to this easy, healthy and very tasty soup.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;ntrodrig;5;Excellent, hearty soup!! I added 3/4 packet of chicken bouillon powder, a hint of red pepper flakes and oregano in addition to the Italian seasoning. I also used about 4-5 tablespoons of canned diced tomatoes since I didn't have fresh tomatoes on-hand. I used garbanzo and cannellini beans and chicken broth.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lizzycooks4dallas;5;Super yummy! I diced up three pieces of bacon and used the fat to do my sautéing in. Adds an extra layer of goodness. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was great!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mimirose;5;Made this soup for the first time. Very easy to make. I didn't fine chop the kale and I thought it was perfect, I also added chopped celery and carrots and garlic salt as I had no fresh garlic. My husband thought it was the best soup I ever made. I think I might add more veggies and maybe some meat.. This is the first recipe I have ever rated.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;vivian;5;Delicious! My husband usually hates kale but enjoyed it so much! I did not tell him what it was until after he had a SECOND helping! Said it did not taste like kale at all!! A definite winner! The only change I did was that I rinsed my beans before adding-I usually do-and added a can of petite diced tomatoes.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;tankmorton;5;This is so easy & so hearty! Delicious!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;andreaburgess;5;This was simply AMAZING! I never thought about blending part of the soup together to make a thicker broth. I've since used that for versions soups.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;cookiemonster;5;I had everything to make this soup. Doubled the recipe for leftovers. Used three regular tomatoes and 1 can of fire roasted because that's what I had on hand. Skipped salt, pepper and parsley and it was still really good. Even my picky eleven year-old thought it was tasty. Keeper!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;veggienewbie;5;Great flavor! Used frozen chopped kale, but kept everything else the same. Great way to use up my garden tomatoes. Yummy!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;dory;4;Overall it is not a bad soup.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;paulhallmark;5;Made this tonight, like as most people I made a few changes... Added sliced brats, carrots, rotel tomatoes with green peppers, and a combination of white beans and garbanzos.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;maryndalen;5;I've made this soup many times. It's tasty and versatile. I usually throw all ingredients into the crockpot and let it cook all day. Sometimes I'll add cut up potatoes which work really well. Usually I use canned tomatoes because that's what is in the pantry. You really can't screw up this soup and it's healthy which is a huge plus.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mkstevens09;4;I like that this is a healthy soup that does not involve a lot of prep work. I also like the idea of thickening the soup with pureed beans, but using those beans for thickening only left a few in the soup. I would add in additional beans next time, especially since that is the only part my two year olds like to eat!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;britto;5;We had a pretty long and sporadic winter this year in Washington, D.C., and while I was on a kale binge (with tons left over from a salad), I decided to search out a soup involving the green superfood. I stumbled across this highly reviewed recipe and I was more than impressed. I love how the soup depends a lot on the natural flavors of the vegetables (and how much better does it feel to pick and chop your own veggies? Fresh.). My only addition to this recipe was a couple chopped carrots to add to the heartiness of the soup, although I am really curious about adding butternut squash. My boyfriend loved it, and my little brother, not too fond of kale, ate it without any comments on the kale other than the soup being good. Heartwarming dish for the winter, or for an easy dish that can be eaten throughout the week. Great with bread.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jannyt;5;I made this true to recipe, and it was awesome! Thanks
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;darashea;5;This soup was so good!! I wanted to start using kale in my diet and was looking for a recipe that was simple to use. I read some reviews to get tips and followed the recipe almost exactly. I didn't have plum tomatoes but a chunky vegetable soup with them in it. I strained the soup and used the vegetables. I also had some mushrooms so sauted baby portabello mushrooms with the onions. This came out so well and definitely will make again. Thanks for the recipe now other kale recipes will have to live up to this standard!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;luvgodnusa;5;Love this soup! When I made it this time I did 3tsp of base to 4 cups of water to dilute the salty broth a bit. I also used 4 roma tomatoes, popped them in when the recipe calls and when they had cooked enough for the skin to peel pulled them out, peeled and chopped, then added them back in. I try to use fresh whenever possible. Topping with a touch of Parmesan (or three cheese blend) is tasty, and a good loaf of garlic/herb bread on the side. YUM!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;spk2thequeen;5;Easy 15m w/lid on, 15m off Fine chop greens Added 1/4c fine shredded carrots At the end add 1tbsp lemon juice
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;cynditschacher;4;I added Italian sausage and it was delicious!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mema;4;This was very good and I felt good eating such healthy soup. I will probably make again and play with the ingredients a bit to make it a 5 star.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;siobhan;5;This recipe was delicious. The only thing I changed was that I used a can if diced tomatoes cause I was too lazy to chop my own. Still came out great
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;wendyl;5;I made this exactly the way it was written and it was a huge hit with my entire family!! (Actually, I take that back...I added a little turkey sausage for my husband who thinks a meal isn't complete without meat!)
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;curiosity;5;Fantastic hardy soup! The first time I made this I followed the receipt exactly and thoroughly enjoyed it. Having a craving for kale I decided to make it once again, however, made changes based on the ingredients I had on hand. In addition to onions and garlic, I added two finely sliced celery stocks in the saute. After the kale wilted down, I supplemented two finely sliced carrots, replaced the white beans with one can each of rinsed chick peas and black beans, substituted the plum tomatoes with one can of diced tomatoes and added approximately three square inches of chopped parmesan cheese rind. Since my pot was almost full, I topped it off with as much chicken broth that I could fit and simmered for two hours. When serving myself I put in a healthy squirt of Sriracha sauce, which I add to most of my home made meals as I like the kick of heat and flavour. Using less broth turns this into a substantial kale vegetable stew. This is an excellent base recipe that you can easily personalize.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;adharamsi;5;I added 1lb of Jimmy Dean Hot pork sausage and used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh since I had it on hand. It was a hit, I got many compliments and requests for the recipe. I'll be making this again!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;leonda58;4;I'm giving it four stars because it's flexible and healthy. My family found it a bit bland, despite the garlic. Will try again and add a bit of either cooking sherry or red wine.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;iamsavedbygrace;5;First time cooking with kale. Healthy and delicious!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;teresat;5;This is one of our favorite soups. I added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes for some kick. Good way to get some kale in your diet.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;katiemarie;5;This is my favorite soup! I'm 100% in love with this recipe!!! Even my husband who hates kale really likes it!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;ilovepotatoes;3;Okay
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;elisa;5;Excellent easy recipe. Wouldn't change anything
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;tifffafa;5;I've made this soup so many times and I just love it! I usually add either chicken sausage or turkey kielbasa so I up the broth a bit which usually means I also up the kale. I also don't always puree the beans only because of laziness and to save dirty dishes. I will usually make it on a Sunday and package in single serve containers for my lunches. It freezes VERY well which is a huge plus for me!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;tinam;5;Having just purchased kale for the first time and spending some time for recipes, I was excited that I found a soup with beans. I toasted a nice slice of organic whole grain bread and let it cool and dry, then added some of the cheese and let it float in my bowl. This is awesome stuff and so glad I discovered such a great recipe for kale.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;gail;5;Very tasty, very easy and healthy to boot!! Only change I made was to add a few pieces of pepperoni I had hanging out in the fridge.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;bekahchan;5;One of my favorite soup recipes. So healthy and delicious!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;barbo;4;Good. Make sure to chop kale fine.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;elizabethmoes;5;This was amazing! Super easy to assemble and stew. We made it the night before and went into town and back in a snowstorm. When we got home, after shovelling snow to get in our driveway it was HEAVEN!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;katcarraway;5;Perfect with a sandwich on a winter day,
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;annacatespersonalchef;4;It took a half a bottle of white wine and a good bit of salt to make this taste good, But, once those were added it was pretty darn good.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;caroldaillynch;5;Great! I added chopped fully cooked chicken sausage and finely chopped potatoes for bulk. I also subbed grape tomatoes for the chopped plum. So good! Next time I will add a dash of cayanne and orzo. The recipe is easy to modify to your liking!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;angiem24;5;This was awesome! I had a bundle of kale in my fridge that I refused to throw away so I looked up some recipes. I use turkey stock in place of chicken broth because it was all I had. I added corn and veggie penne but kept all the other ingredients the same. Great! My family loved it! Even the kids!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;toni;5;Excellent I used butterbeans
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;bb;5;This was a huge hit! I didnt have enough kale (which you need to be sure to use just leaves and cut into spoon size) so i added spinach. I also added 1/2 c of sliced carrots and celery as well as crumbled turkey sausage (I buy the Jimmy Dean fully cooked crumbled turkey sausage and keep in freezer for all uses.). We loved it!!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;cathy;3;I really hoped we would love this soup, since kale is so nutritious. But unfortunately my family did not care for this recipe. I ended up eating it for my lunches. I think it probably did taste better the next day.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;maemarx;5;Can certainly personalize to your liking, but totally delicious as is! Quick, easy and healthy and the whole family enjoys it!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;suzyq;4;A good and healthy soup. Fresh parsley is a MUST - it helps to camouflage the kale and balances out the flavours in the soup. I made as directed.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;radishrosette;5;Great recipe! Fast and simple to make and very tasty.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;rhondabrustkern;5;Super flavor and easy soup and just gets better overnight. I subbed canned diced tomatoes for the roma (out of season), skipped adding salt since I didn't drain and rinse the beans and skipped blending because I like a brothy soup and why dirty a blender. Had it again for breakfast, definitely a keeper.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;novamari;5;Excellent recipe! I've made it several times now and each time I do something a little different like adding chopped carrots, celery, and potatoes or vegetable alphabet pasta. I make it in my pressure cooker and it comes out tasting fantastic.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;furiousrose;5;Just made this recipe today. I followed the recipe for the most part, except I used 7 teaspoons of minced garlic in the jar and added Italian sausage to it. Turned out yummy! I think there could've been a little more kale and maybe some diced up carrots. Otherwise, a really good recipe. Thanks !
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mpindc;5;"I'm always looking for other way to use kale. This is a great soup and tastes better the second day (if there is any left!). The recipe is good ""as is"" - I like it even better with a few additions. I add chopped carrots, celery and some roasted red pepper. Because local/homegrown tomatoes aren't available this time of year, I used pureed tomatoes instead (better than diced, in my opinion). I puree about 1/3 of the vegetables/beans to thicken the soup. Adding toasted orzo or other small pasta towards the end makes it a bit heartier. And adding lime juice and cilantro at the vey end boosts the flavor."
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;shanamonkey;5;I did this the lazy way and just threw it all in a pot. I also added 3 medium white potatoes and a large fresh sprig of rosemary. Yum!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;tikiong;5;loved it! Added a little ginger and drained my beans. Came out perfect!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;samnierop;5;DIVINE!!! Sounds so simple but it's SO flavorful! I added carrots and used white and red navy beans. Served with Organic Rustic Garlic Bread and Balsamic Vinegar. Now my husband and I's FAVORITE soup! Very hearty and filling. THANK YOU!!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;suprmom;5;delicious!!! I AM IN LOVE! I am new to kale. Starting to eat less calories, less meat based foods through the week, we are a meat, starch, and veggie family but with each meal, with the exception of breakfast (sometimes!!), and this is one of my new found favorites. It is FILLING, and sticks with us, doesn't fill us up and wear off in an hour after eating. Of course we have some bread with it, but hey, it's still delicious and healthy too! I used chicken bouillon since I had no veg. or chic. stock, added more kale, an extra clove of garlic and used scallions and yellow onion. I used a few extra cups of stock (mix), and a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes with juice left in it, and drained 2 cans of cannellini beans and 1 can of chick peas (peeled, i can't stand the skins on them!), added a teaspoon more of the italian seasoning and it was SOOO yummy. It would be amazing by the original directions, but I just went with it and then some. I LOVE all recipes.com, it is the best place to get great recipes.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;andreasampson;5;Great! I didn't have cannellini beans, but used a 16-bean soup mix instead. Also threw in some cubed ham for the carnivores in the family. So easy & satisfying- will be making this frequently this winter.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mia;5;I had Kale in my fridge because I like to make green smoothies but got tired of having a beverage for a meal. I googled Kale recipes and found this one. It is very delicious, filling and low priced and low fat! I also had left over rotisserie chicken that I shredded and threw in the pot. Yumm!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;andrewsgirls;5;This soup is wonderful. I add chopped carrots and a bit of diced red pepper in to the saute at the beginning to give it more vegetables......Healthy and satisfying!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kara63;5;Tried this recipe because I'm trying to incorporate kale into my diet. The only change I made was to split the beans 1/2 navy & 1/2 garbanzo. Wow was I satisfied! When the 7 year old granddaughter loves AND it's healthy - it's a keeper!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;nathan;5;I started by using fresh farmers market white beans boiled with a smoked ham hock in water and chicken broth. Then followed the original recipe adding cayenne powder and 1/2 stick of butter. Once beans were boiled for about an hour, I Simmered low and slow for 2 hours. FANTASTIC!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;wags;4;Very tasty. Only because I had it around, I threw in some chopped bacon with the onions and added some stelline pasta in the last 15 minutes.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;australia1;4;This was very flavorful. I added about 1/8 cup white wine vinegar. Kids even liked it.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;marytegtmeier;5;This recipe was very yummy and easy. I made it exactly like listed except I added some mushrooms and smoked sausage. delish! Even my brother who does not like Kale had 2 bowls of it. this is a keeper.

e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;debrathomson;4;This was good. It is almost identical to a pasta fagioli recipe that I have, minus the pasta.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;deb;4;This was good. It is almost identical to a pasta fagioli recipe that I have, minus the pasta.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;steve;4;Yes, we too should have cut the kale smaller. We added 1/4 lb. of hot sausage and it was a delicious meal.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;cheesemite;5;This was great!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jc;5;This is a delicious soup. I plan to make this again and pass down the recipe to my daughters - they loved it! It reminded us of a peasant soup we make, but this recipe is much simpler.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lovesfood;5;But add more tomatoes and broth, then use fresh herbs like basil, oregano, cilantro and summer savory, and cayenne.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;emmae;4;This is a good basic healthy recipe. I will make it again.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;diz9829;4;"Kale is something I don't care for and I'm ""learning"" to like it. I have a long way to go, but this recipe is so heavy on garlic that you really don't notice the kale. I was going to cut back on the 8 cloves, but given the rave reviews I decided to follow the recipe. I was kind of worried. My eyes were burning as the garlic smell lingered through the house while it cooked. Even though you could really taste the garlic, it still had a good over all flavor."
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;auramiron;5;I made this recipe today and it was a total hit! My entire family (including the kids, ages 10 and under) loved it and even asked for seconds! I made a few changes based on what I had on hand: added boneless chicken thighs cut up small to hot oil, added carrots, celery, six fresh large ripe tomatoes instead of canned tomatoes, only one can of beans and chopped up the kale into small pieces as others recommended, 8 cups total of chicken broth,1 extra tsp of Italian seasoning, 1 tbsp of Vegeta (soup seasoning) and added 1 cup of small bowtie pasta a few minutes before it was all done. Did not blend any ingredients. It turned out amazing! It tastes like high end restaurant quality soup for sure! Thanks for the great recipe!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jennataylor1990;5;Kale can replaced with cabbage, escarole, collards, or mustards. pretty much whatever green you have in the garden. I also reduce the stock and add carrots
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;missyhubbardroatch;5;super easy and super tasty. Will definitely make this one again!!!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;frogghaven;5;This soup had great flavors. Used fresh Roma tomatoes and kale from the local farmers market. I didn't thicken the soup with the beans and broth and I added a pinch or two of red pepper flakes for a bit of a kick.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jpetersot;5;This is a very easy soup to make and I always have these ingredients on hand anyway. Works well with any beans. I agree that it is better with kale cut smaller. There are so many ways to vary this based on what you have on hand. this is super easy with exception of the blender. would be much easier with immersion blender I assume.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;tanya;5;Great recipe! Very healthy, fast and easy to cook. Definitely makimg it again!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;cupcakepolly;4;I really liked this soup
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;cindyjennessnawrocki;3;Add some carrots for color!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;sugasuga;4;Loved it! I had some left over fresh collards and used that instead the first time I made it. My 20 year old son and I couldn't get enough of it. Used the fresh kale the second time and found the leaves too tough. I sauteed it longer and cooked it in the soup longer and was still too tough. I will still make this again using a different green.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;margabassett;5;"Used only Cannellini beans from the can and the rest were fresh items . Added fresh cut carrots with the onions and garlic to saute .2 Vegetable cubes were substituted for the low fat ,low sodiun chicken or vegetable broth . My husband absolutely loved it and the smell in the kitchen too .Took some to my co worker and she was like "" Please bring me this recipe ."""
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;swedishjenny;5;I made this soup exactly as written besides the addition of two sweet potatoes I needed to get rid of. Delish!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;katinapersinger;5;I ended up trying this recipe because I had kale that I didn't know what to do with. This was the BEST tasting soup ever! It was even better the next day. The kale really added to the taste of the soup to give it that extra punch.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mamad;5;Okay, this is so delicious I had to comment. I used the pastine white kidney beans and canned tomatoes and this really pleased everyone in the house. I love kale because it's healthy, but I have a hard time eating it :) This soup however, makes it quite easy. I also throw some spinach in towards the end, just because :) Oh I also don't have italian seasoning so I just threw in a bunch of parsley while cooking. Really, really good.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;tammyyoung;5;Yummy!! I was very surprised at how the seasonings created a unique tasting bean soup. I will definitely do this again!! Love having a new way to eat more kale!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;michele;5;I liked it, was good
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;dswinnick;4;This was great...I added spicy chorizo and did not blend the beans with the last bit of broth..even so, I thought it a bit thick and will add more liquid the next time I make it. I made it the day before I served it, and put some parm cheese on the top...with a bit of extra hot sauce, as well.. I will definatelyf make this again.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;vicki;4;I used fresh spinach from my garden instead of kale. Used two bay leaves and a little cayenne pepper, along with remaining ingredience. Very good.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;yummy;5;Really great soup! Can easily be tweaked if you'd like. I used organic truRoots dehydrated sprouted bean trio (lentils, adzuki, and mung beans). Rehydrated the beans separately then added to recipe. Also added about a tablespoon of small pieces of smoked pancetta which I browned separately in some olive oil then added to the soup. Also added 2 tsp of lemon juice. I did cut the kale into small pieces, but since I was to be feeding this to my 2 year old I took my hand held immersion blender and ended up blending some more. Perfect! I completely puréed some that I kept aside to feed my 9 month old. He loved it! Will make again and again with leftovers to freeze! Will try with pasta or rice, and adding pieces of ham or sausage. If you'd like, you can easily make it thicker or not by adding less or more liquid. Top with Parmigiano. Enjoy!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;karac;5;Added carrots and celery. Also followed another reviewer and simmered uncovered for 15 minutes and then covered for 20 minutes to intensify the favor. Delicious!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;alissaprivitera;4;Very healthy and surprisingly delicious! I followed the recipe as written, except I omitted the parsley at the end. I might have used more kale than suggested (not sure, used 1 bunch, chopped). Using the blender to puree some of the broth and beans was key. My husband and I loved it and the kids both liked it well enough (each ate their whole serving). I served it with tomato and swiss cheese sandwiches on pumpernickel. Great meal!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;djvill;4;Very tasty. Cooked it pretty much as-is, except that I mashed the remaining beans manually and simmered the soup for about an hour and a half to let the flavors mix all together. It was a big hit with my friends!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;pampereddawn;4;Very yummy. I added chicken breast to this and shredded after it was cooked thru. I didn't bother to smash up some of the beans as I knew that shredding the chicken and letting it simmer would thicken it as well.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;krickyr;5;I was looking for another way to use kale and was pleasantly surprised that this soup was even better than I'd hoped it would be. Next time I'll add even more kale, as it can handle it. It would be delicious with chopped ham added, too.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;crogerswvk12kyus;5;"My Italian Grandmother used to make ""Bean Soup"" every Friday, especially during Lent. This tastes so much like it; it took me back to my childhood. She used cauliflower instead of Kale, but the taste is the same and the Kale gives it a nice color and used tomato paste, instead of chopped tomatoes. But, really it is basically the same recipe. She always mashed all of the beans, even in her Italian version of Chili. It makes the soup so full-bodied. Her ""Bean Soup"" was served over homemade Graham Bread. She filled a big bowl with a whole loaf of chunked up Graham Bread and then poured the pot of soup over it. The bread soaked up the soup and it was very substantial. I think when I make this next time, I will add a bit of bulgur wheat. It has the same taste as the Graham Bread. I do that when I make Grandma's soup. It adds a nice nutty flavor and also is very healthy. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!!"
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;suetausch;5;Made this tonight. Wasn't thrilled about blending the beans but had no idea they were even there. I could not taste the kale which is a huge plus. I added tomatoes and red peppers and it really sweetened it up. My carnivorous husband had seconds. I will be making this weekly!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;twiggy;5;Excellent as written. Will be making often!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;elph;3;Fine and dandy but use organic ingredients to prepare this!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;amyevans;5;I loved this! It was surprisingly filling for a light, vegetarian soup. I loved the kale, tomato, and white bean combination. I also think it's genius to puree some of the beans to thicken the soup.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;flanny;5;"Huge fan of this soup! My brother and pregnant sister-in-law were coming over for dinner with their three year old, and my husband and I are vegetarians. My brother gave the kale a look as if I had dropped a mouse into his soup, but after one bite, he was hooked. All the adults ended up going back for seconds, and in my proudest moment of the night, the three year old tried her mom's soup and declared ""Oh mama, I like this!"" I followed the recipe pretty closely. We are huge garlic fans, so the amount requested was not too much for us, although we do typically use more garlic than many recipes call for, so if you are sensitive to garlic - consider using less. I also added in 8oz of crimini mushrooms and one can of diced tomatoes at my brother's request. For broth, I prefer the Better Than Bullion ""No Chicken Base"" for vegetarian soups. It has a much better flavor than many mushroom based broths, and a little goes a long way! I let the soup simmer about 30 min instead of 15, but it was still pretty tasty at 15 minutes. We topped ours with a few scallions instead of parsley, and we served this with a crusty sourdough bread. The next day - the leftovers were even tastier!"
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;randakaye;5;Excellent! Love how simple this was to make and the flavor is amazing. Ended up skipping the broth. This will be a regular for us. Thanks so much for sharing!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;chelseadavidson;5;Great recipe! It is a new favorite.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lindab;4;Delish!!! I just made this with a few additions. I added carrots, zucchini and some pasta. Also added tomatoe sauce, I didn't have any tomatoes. It was the first time I ever had kale and it was wonderful. I will definately make this again.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kendra;5;Great soup - but the key is making your own broth!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;deb;5;Hearty and absolutely delicious! Tried the original recipe and it was perfection. I wanted to incorporate more vegetables in my diet so I added zucchini and okra...it only added to the myriad of flavors. I also added Scotch Bonnet pepper for some spice. I could eat this every day!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;loveleigh98;5;I omitted the onion and parsley- upped chicken broth to 7 cups, added 3/4 cup dry orzo and cubed uncooked chicken breasts and cooked it in my pressure cooker for 10 minutes. I also used canned tomatoes, because that's what I had. We sprinkled some fresh grated parmesan on and it was really good!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;dale;5;This was a really nice surprise. I should have chopped the kale smaller, but the flavor and ease of this recipe was great! I will definitely make it again.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;ebeth;5;Better than I expected. It was quite flavorful given the simple ingredients and relatively easy to make. I will consider doubling and freezing half next time. I'm not experienced with kale so I did not include its thick ribs.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;susan;5;we both loved this soup! sooooo yummy! I changed this a LOT. 1) used a blend of dried beans that I bought from costco (soak night before, etc), 2) sauteed some onion, garlic, carrots...added the chopped up kale ...and more olive oil 3) also sauteed 2 red sweet peppers 4) when kale was wilted, added veg broth and beans (and blended a cup plus of beans and bean broth). add herbs de provence and parmesan cheese rind. served with grated parm cheese.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;v;4;Per our preference, it's a 4 as it's written. We preferred adding a 1 tsp red pepper flakes (we like a little spice to our food). We also cooked 4 pieces of no-nitrate thick cut black pepper, applewood smoked bacon, removed bacon after cooking and used the grease in place of oil to saute the garlic and onion then kale (finely chopped per others recommendations). We then topped with a piece of smoked gouda cheese but kids preferred Parmesan then crumbled bacon before serving and these minor changes made this a 5-star for us. Thanks for sharing.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jackie;5;Loved this soup! Even though it doesn't require a lot of time to cook it still had flavor like it had simmered all day. I took some of the suggestions from others and cooked the kale a little longer and cut up into small pieces. I also waited until about 10 minutes from completion to add the tomatoes. At the end I added fresh grated parmesan cheese. So yummy on a cold January day but truthfully it was so good that I could eat it in the summer!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mayasmomma;5;I used kidney beans and didn't use parsley. Also, I used baby kale, which requires no chopping. Delicious!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;april;5;Easy, fast, delicious and nutritious. I have made this soup repeatedly. I didn't blend anything and skipped the Italian seasoning. I love the Whole Foods 365 brand of Cannellini beans in a carton instead of a can. They contain no salt and don't have that can aftertaste. Enjoy!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;loricakes;4;Good. I added an extra cup of water though and had to increase the spices to compensate.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;celestialcookingceara;5;Love this recipe! It is so healthy and yummy! Delicious! The only thing I changed was that I rinsed the beans and do not have a food processor so I mashed them up with a fork and it worked perfectly. Also, I let the soup simmer for an hour + so that all the flavours could blend together :)
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jessica;5;I LOVE this soup and have made it several times. I haven't changed a think as far as the recipe. I do sprinkle a little hot sauce in my bowl before I eat it! :-) Delicious and very flavorful and filling!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jo;5;One of the best non meat soup's I've ever made. Used fresh carrots and celery. Otherwise the recipe is great as is.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;gerrietp;5;This was a great and easy soup to make with alot of flavor. I have never cooked kale so was looking for something easy. I used canned tomato that was onion and garlic seasoned and followed recipe from there. This will be a great light soup to make and get some greens in. As other said I simmered for about 30 mins to get great flavor and kale tender. Great soup.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;ropo59;5;This was SOOOOOO good! I needed to make a bigger batch for for a family get together, so I modified it a bit by increasing the number of tomatoes, adding an extra can of beans (I rinsed the canned beans), two stalks of celery diced, 2 carrots diced, bay leaves, doubled the stock (8 cups) and threw in a handful of small pasta (acini di pepe) about 15 minutes before it was finished. Because kale is a rather tough green, I stripped out the center vein and thinly sliced the leaves and sauteed them with the onion in the olive oil about 15 minutes at the beginning before I added the other ingredients. I recommend giving the kale a head start in the cooking process so it isn't chewy - I let the soup simmer for about 45 minutes to an hour covered...the soup turned out fantastic and everyone absolutely raved about it and wanted the recipe!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;maramonclus;5;Delicious! I substituted one of the cans of white beans with Goya seasoned white beans in can, gave a little extra flavor. Served with a side of white rice. Great way to enjoy super healthy Kale!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;farmhousefood;5;tasty and healthy! Couldn't believe my family loved it...it does after all contain Kale! Great recipe!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;karenkinm;5;Excellent soup! Not too brothy and not too chunky. Painless way to eat healthy greens.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jennifercooper;4;This was yummy, nothing special in the flavor dept, but good, and super nutritious! My 3yo and I ate it with toasted slices of hearty Italian bread from Puglia. We scooped it onto the bread which had been drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with salt. Yum. For my 3yo I chopped the kale smaller than I normally would have, but I ended up liking it that way too. Never would have thought I'd get my toddler to eat kale, so this is a keeper!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;amyb;5;Absolutely delicious! We loved it!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;dedward82;5;"Great variation on standard navy/white bean soup. In enjoyed the 1st batch as-is but made a few tweaks to the 2nd batch: - I prefer hearty soups so I doubled the beans and eased off on the chicken broth; - I used cherry tomatoes (since I keep those on hand) and ended up really liking the difference in texture (canned tomatoes also work decently but I was less a fan); and - I added dried parsley directly into the soup with the other seasonings and made sure to adequately salt (~1/2 to 1 tsp). In short, this is a great winter soup I will definitely be making again!"
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;tashfaulky;5;we cooked this in our Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden classes this week and it was quite a hit with all primary school classes.We used tinned tomatoes as our own tomatoes aren't in season just yet and used a stick blender for a few seconds to give the broth a thicker texture while leaving it chunky. this is definitely going on our seasonal menu :)
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;bethanyhaywood;5;I have made this several times & wouldn't change a thing! My sister says this soup is addictive.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;sarahjamesrogers;4;Soup was a little heavy on the onion and garlic side for me, but otherwise good. Flavors really improved after a day or so.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;karenmccleanemullin;5;Excellent on a cold Fall night!! I did use 4 cans (14oz,) chicken broth, used 2 cans of cannellini beans in the soup whole and the pureed 1 can of can of cannellini beans, first time that I ever had kale and the soup was delicious.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;minimo;5;perfect soup for a cold cloudy day, very flavorful!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;blondie;4;I thought this was basically very good - though just a tad on the bland side... I took others' advice and added some carrots and a bit of red pepper flake, but it needed something more... on my second bowl I decided to add a touch of celery seed and, voila', that made a world of difference and added just that little something extra. I will definitely make this again, as I'm trying to do more meatless dishes to try to incorporate healthier eating habits. Thank you for sharing :o)
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;dee;5;This soup is fantastic! I top it with grated Parmesan cheese and serve with rosemary olive oil bread for dipping. If your a meat lover, it's also great with some shredded chicken added to the mix.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;colette;5;Love this recipe. I followed the instructions and the only thing was I didn't have any tomatoes so, I had to use a 1/3 of cup of tomato sauce that I had on hand. I had to use frozen kale because the fresh was not available at the local store. I cooked the kale till it was pretty soft and it was already chopped into bite sized pieces so, that was a time saver. Thanks, for a healthy and delicious recipe.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;808gidget;5;I havent tried this yet but it sounds wonderful. I love putting kale in my lentil soup so this will be another way if I dont have lentils.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;pinkxg1rl;4;Very simple and quick to make and it's so healthy. I followed it pretty exactly. It was still a little bland to me so I added extra italian seasonings.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;heatherlilly;5;Very very good, especially given how healthy it is. I think I would tweak it some next time though - perhaps a little more tomato, a little more beans and maybe a little less garlic (just by a bulb or 2. I love garlic but found the taste in this soup slightly overpowering.)
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mindylivingston;5;This is a simple and rustic soup, very delicious! I substituted one can of cannellini beans with a can of red navy beans, fresh herbs for the dried Italian seasoning, and chose veggie broth to make this a vegan recipe. Wonderful!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;dlsblue;5;This soup is excellent - I even omitted the part with the blender/food processor as I was in a hurry.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;michaelem;5;wow! I'm hooked! Yum!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;20477;4;This Was great. I used dried beans instead of canned to avoid the sodium. I also cooked my beans with smoked turkey to add flavor. I added celery and carrots as well. Before serving, I added a orzo to each bowl.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mallybills;5;This is a fabulous recipe. I love thickening the soup with the beans. I actually used my immulsion blender and did the beans/broth in a separate small pan. I also used fresh beans instead of canned. I just did the quick-soak method and then simmered the soup for a couple of hours to let the flavors blend. I didn't add the tomatoes until near the end. Me and my 2 vegetarian sons loved it. I set aside some for my hubby and fried up some italian sausage and added that to his. I doubled the recipe and we'll all eat on it all week for lunches, quick dinners. YUM!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;npappas732;5;This was a super easy dish to make and very nice veggie type soup. I cooked the soup about 30mins instead of only 15 mins like the recipe calls for...I might try adding cooked chicken to the soup next time.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;cyndykopitsky;5;yum. I added some quinoa and it was super good. I used organic white beans too. A different bean would taste different, worth a try as well. I used a lot of kale, more than this calls for in the recipe
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;linda;2;Good base. I thought it was very bland and lacked flavor. I had to add 2 more cans of beans, Nature's Seasoning, red pepper, and kielbasa
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lkgeorge;3;All but Katie liked it. Nice and healthy
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;emilyv;5;This was really good. I added a few carrots, a little white wine, and a few more spices. This is quick, filling and healthy!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;californiadreamin;4;My husband raved about this. My daughter, who usually isn't keen on soup had 2 helpings. I used frozen chopped kale for convenience. I also didn't bother taking the blender out. I just mashed 1 can of the beans a bit with a potato masher, right in the soup pot. This was easy and so healthy.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;halfnotes;5;"Someone brought this to a church function and shared the recipe with everyone. I really loved it and assume that she made it as written. I will certainly be making this one for the family! Update 2/16/13: I finally made this for my family and it was delicious! The only change I made to the recipe was that I rinsed and drained the cannellini beans. To make the meal a little more substantial, we served it with quinoa (the two mixed together tasted fabulous!). My 5 year old said, ""That was definitely a 5 star meal!"""
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;trishcliftonwiltshire;5;Delicious & health! I sauted 3 large leeks & 1/2 diced potato with the onion & garlic. I then pureed all of it with 1/2 of the beans & it thickened the soup nicely! I have made this twice now--cooking the kale until really tender takes at least 15 minutes and is worth the wait Great with crusty bread & sliced tomatoes w/balsamic vinegar--yum!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;pameladaproposofnothing;5;Always add carrots too. Great freezer soup.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;h3r1h;5;Since we took part a CSA this year, we've had far more kale than we've seen in our lives. This recipe is great for annihilating it. I usually add 1-2 cans of diced tomatoes rather than fresh, and throw in some chopped zucchini. I seem to add red pepper flakes to everything because I like the heat, and this get a teaspoon as well. The flavor is great, and my husband inhales it.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;tracylee;5;My first thoughts before I ever made this recipe was that this is going to be nasty. I don't like beans. I'm not fond of greens in my soup. But when I made it, WOW. It's a really good soup! 3 out of 4 of my kids even ate it! I'll definitely make this again when I have extra kale. One thing I did do differently, I added more chicken broth and shredded chicken breasts because my husband won't eat a meal without meat.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;belled;5;I made this soup as written, but I did forget the Italian herb seasoning. I made half a recipe to test it out. It is fabulous. I wish I had made the entire amount. I did, however, increase the cooking time, because I like softer kale. I will make this again and I will still leave out the Italian herbs. Very good without, too.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;meghan;5;"impressively good! this super healthy recipe doesn't taste ""healthy."""
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;irvinesanderstupperwarecons;5;THIS WAS FAST AND EASY. I PUT A LITTLE TO MUCH ITALIAN SEASONING .OVER ALL REALLY GOOD
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;marni07;5;I love this soup! It actually made me a kale lover! I usually dont have tomatoes just laying around, so when I am in the mood for this, I just use 1 can of diced tomatoes instead. And occasionally I sautee chicken and add it. Yum!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;fifi;5;AMAZING!!!! So delicious even my 11 year old son ate it. Highly recommend.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;katies;5;I really liked this. I used baby kale from the farmer's market, so there was no problem with the big vein running down the middle of the leaf. Great flavor, spices were just right, didn't even have to add extra salt. Tomatoes do get a little mushy, so if you like firmer tomatoes, don't add them until the end.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;sharonb;5;Perfect. My family loved and I was pleased because it is healthy and easy to make!fyi when shopping parsley is for garnish, I bought it and didn't end up using it.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;cherylmarie;5;I loved this soup! It was so very flavorful. I did use a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh. I also used 2 cups veggie broth (I only had two cups left prepared) and 2 cans of chicken broth. This came out to an extra cup or so over what the recipe called for. Most importantly, heed the other recommendations, this needs to simmer much longer in order to have the kale tender enough. I simmered mine (covered to avoid too much evaporation) for almost 45 minutes.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;princessqueen;5;"Delicious. My husband doesn't always like experiments with green so I was worried. He LOVED it. I didn't have fresh parsley so substituted with dried. Used my own homemade chicken stock. Added leftover chunks of chicken and beef we had from a restaurant dinner. Served with couscous on the side. Added garlic salt and pepper and squeezed lemon on top right before serving with a sprinkle of grated Parmesan. My husband said, ""We can do that again!"" we ended up dumping the couscous into the soup. Yum."
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;julieco1;5;Delicious, easy and healthy. i added extra beans and served it with hot sauce (sriracha) on the side
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;momof4;5;This was really good! I cooked up some chicken sausages and then added that to the soup and used a can of diced tomatoes. I made quinoa and black beans as a side but was great to add to the soup. Just be sure to add it right when you are going to eat it. It can soak up the liquid if it sits in it too long. My young kids loved it! So did the hubby. He went back for seconds later that night!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;teacherwhocooks;5;So good! I added carrots, which just enhanced it. It's just delicious!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;valentine;4;Really tasty! Bf and I made this soup but changed it to add a package of bacon: So instead of using any olive oil we just chopped up the bacon and let it fry for a bit, and added the rest of the ingredients more or less as the recipe instructed. I did add maybe 3 cups more water to the recipe in addition to the chicken soup to make it more soup-y, because we had a lot of kale, and the bacon. In the end we only used one can of white beans (not sure what kind), and let the soup simmer for maybe an extra 20 or 30 min to thicken it a little. Didn't do the blending. Flavor was great :)
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;cookinmamab;5;Great crowd pleaser! Kids and adults all enjoyed it. Easy to make, too!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lcherian;5;Delicious and easy to make! I added some Lou's Famous Cilantro chicken sausage.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;christiesapienza;5;Tis is THEE BEST Kale soup Ive ever made. My boyfriend is a farmer so naturally you could imagine how many vegetables we eat, and believe me, ive cooked kale many times and this combination is SO TASTY! there is a real balance to the bitterness in the kale that makes you want to pick up the pot and pour this soup straight down your throat!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;auriana;5;LOVE this soup. My non vegan dad BEGS me to make it all the time...and it's so easy to play around with!!! Sometimes I replace the beans with potatoes...sometimes I add carrots or other veggies- it's very easy to improvise with whatever you have! Soooo delicious!!!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;debbiek;4;Wish it made more. Really good though once I increased the spice.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lmk23;4;Very easy, tasty and healthy. Added some grated cheese to it and it was a hit.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;christine;5;I search for simple and delicious recipes. This one's a keeper! I added chopped carrots, and simmered a piece of Parmesan rind in it for added flavor. Topped with shredded Parmesan. Half of my family eats meat, so I browned some Italian turkey sausage in a separate skillet, then they added it to their own bowls.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;casullivan2800;5;This was easy to prepare and so declicious. I used white navy beans, but would like to use kidney beans next time because of their texture.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;holidaybaker;2;This soup was really not good. It is healthy, but the seasoning is completely overwhelming! It tastes like water flavored with rosemary and there is strong grassy aftertaste with the parsley. I do not suggest adding it. I never put crackers in soup, but had to add quite a few butter crackers to make this palateable.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;sharonc;5;I loved it, very flavorful. Everyone who tried it loved it as well.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;tarabawden;5;"Add a cup of quinoa! I used this recipe to modify the recipe that came on the back of my ""Bob's Red Mill"" 13 bean soup, which called for 1-1.5 Tbsp Chili powder as the seasoning. Final combo-recipe worked out great. Thank you, the Kale and the garlic (I ended up using a whole head) helped turn it into a lovely flavorful vegetarian meal - my husband was impressed with all the flavor, despite no hamhock/chickenbroth!"
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;tara;5;super easy,even for a busy weeknight.Cheap & yummy..Not to mention my teens love it!Super yummy as is i wouldnt change a thing.A keeper for sure,Thnx for a great recipe :)
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;welldone;5;I love this healthy soup. I had some kale and low-sodium chicken broth that I needed to use. The only change I made was a little veggie broth because I ran out of chicken broth. I will be making this soup again and again because it is the perfect batch to make on Sunday for lunches through the week. Tip: it is much better the 2nd and 3rd day, if you can keep people from eating it before then.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;ollie;3;I was trying to get rid of frozen kale left in freezer along with cans of beans in the pantry. Came across this recipe that fit the situation. Family loved it!!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;caroleb;5;This is the second time I've made this soup and it's definitely a keeper. Did not have any tomatoes, so left them out ... and it was still super good. Also had a little bit of njuda sausage that I added, just because I had it on hand.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jeannieholmes;5;I have made this twice since finding recipe last month. I LOVE this soup. Super easy and delicious. I followed the recipe 100%.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;melissao;5;I halved the recipe...I only had 1/2 an onion + 1 bunch kale which came to just over 2 cups worth... but used a whole ctn of stock and 2 regular tomatoes. shouldve added another can of beans because nobody would've known they were in there! i pureed 3/4 the kale because my hubs is leery of anything leafy & green lol but he'd eat it if it was pureed in soup so thats what I did. Didnt have fresh parsley but did have parm so a little sprinkle went on each bowl. will make this alot and play with ingredients a little bit...maybe some shell pasta a la minestrone?
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;elainekruger;5;I added 1 more can of beans, Did a mix of both cannellini and navy beans, and added Sweet Italian sausage and served it with Shredded parmigian cheese. Everyone Loved it!!! HUGE hit!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;coppertopgurl;4;I made this recipe with a few changes. I added mild sausage meat in the beginning, but I did not add any parsley (not the biggest fan). I chose not to buy the Italian seasoning as I have most of the herbs anyways. I added a teaspoon of liquid smoke as well. I also did not blend the beans and broth as I like my soups chunky. My family loved it!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;conkyjoe;5;Decided to rate this 5*. For us, it came up a bit short on flavor, as written, but can be easily adjusted to satisfy personal taste preferences. Added some orange-ginger seasoned salt & shredded Parmesan cheese, and what a difference this made. This is an extremely high nutritional dish with kale being among the top ANDI scorers. I was unsure as to how much chopped kale would equal 4 cups which turned out to be about one bunch if lightly pressed when measuring.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;misskitty4;5;Loved this soup, will make again for sure. Used a can of tomatoes, as I had no fresh on hand, per another viewer
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lizcancook;4;This is a quick soup and can easily be turned vegetarian (for Lent's Fridays) by subbing vegetable broth. I liked how the soup became 'creamy' with the addition of the blended cannellini beans and broth.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mtayl75234;5;This soup was OUTSTANDING!! I added canned diced tomatoes instead of the plum tomatoes. This was the only change I made. I shared it with my son and daughter-in-law and they also loved it.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;aunte;4;Mild soup with good flavor. Everything blended well and there wasn't one flavor that took over. I made my own broth and only added one can of cannellini. I thought there was plenty of beans. I added chicken pieces to take place of other can of beans for protein.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;beverly;5;Quick, heathly and delicious. Made with beef stock becausei had no chicken. Will definitely make again!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;hungryhippo;4;Used a can of somewhat drained diced tomatoes. Pretty good. Chopped kale small and used about 6 garlic cloves.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;andersona1129;5;This soup is the bomb!! It's so flavorful and filling. I do make a few modifications though. I use three cans of white beans: Cannellini, Navy and Great White Northern Beans. I also add cut carrots, two cups of cooked brown rice and extra broth. It freezes really well and is definitely a new favorite on my rotation!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;terri;5;This was absolutely delicious! I even forgot to purée the beans and it was wonderful. Full of flavor. I also added some shredded cooked chicken just prior to serving. Will be making this again very soon!

e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;evamar97;5;Delicious and easy! Make sure you use flavorful broth, also I served this with a sprinkling of parmesan cheese.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;trish;4;I came across this recipe looking for recipes using kale. I halved the recipe because I only had one can of navy beans and did not have any tomatos on hand. Other than that I prepared it as written. It was very good and I will definitely make it again. I'm sure the tomatos make it even better but it is good even if you don't put them in.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;karlaknackbrooks;5;I needed Iron so I decided to try this recipe. I sauteed my garlic and onions then added everything else (Doubled Kale) to a crockpot for 6 hours on low. I also added 2 chopped carrots and 2 celery. Instead of plum tomatoes add 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes.Last hour I add pre-cooked pasta or brown rice. Loved it.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lauramanosemms;5;So good and perfect for a cold Winter night! Used 1 can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh and added diced fresh carrots and celery. Also, cooked a little longer than suggested. Love the idea of blending a some of the beans! Delish.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mariec;2;For me this soup lacked flavor. To save it I tossed in fresh green beans, roasted carrots, more fresh herbs and some leftover pasta.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;swimyfish;5;Wow, excellent and healthy! Super yummy! I used a can of crushed tomatoes as I did not have fresh on hand. Was not sure about the tomato flavoring until the second day when all the seasonings had time to mingle -- excellent from day 2 and on. Added 4 chopped carrots for added veggies and 2 stalks of celery chopped too! Used Herb de Provence seasoning as others had suggested -- excellent addition instead of italian seasoning!. Had to simmer the soup longer to get my Kale to the desired tenderness!! Will make again and again!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;susannemh;5;Really good! Used a can of diced tomatoes and just 1 can of kidney beans b/c that's all I had, and it was excellent and SO easy! Thanks!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mdcooking;5;FANTASTIC!!! Will make this again and again.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;cataloginglovely;4;This is a solid base recipe. I didn't give it 5 stars because I tweaked it enough that it became my own recipe. But know that you can start with these basic ingredients and proportions and make a delicious soup.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;bibi;5;Very good, satisfying soup! I added a pinch of red pepper flakes for a little extra zip! The tomatoes add a touch of sweetness, the kale was kind of crunchy, and the beans were soft and mellow. All the garlic gives an extra kick to the nutrition. I used the vegetable broth, and this was just right for a chilly Sunday evening. Very easy to put together. Thanks!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mieyunlee;5;Delicious as is. My husband loved it. And so did I.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;rona;5;awesome soup idea! great flavor! i used a TON more kale, because i love kale and i didnt think there was enough after it wilted down (i used probably 3/4 of the large bunch). i also threw in an extra can of beans. i did not have any parsley, so i used about a half cup of green onions. instead of plum, i threw in a whole carton of cherry tomatoes cut in half. tasty, tasty....
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;rizznibor;3;Tastes like minestrone soup. Pasta could be added if desired.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jennifernielsenleroy;5;Awesome! Followed some suggestions and served with Parmesan cheese, cooked a bit longer. I added carrots, celery, and chicken. Otherwise, kept it pretty much the same. Very yummy and simple! Great way to use kale.

e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;heatherg;5;This is one of the very few recipes that I will not make a single change to in the future. Our new favorite soup! Had to insist everyone try that first bite but after that they finished the first bowl and all requested more. Thanks so much for sharing!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;ronalyn;5;This soup is fantastic (I'm eating a bowlful right now). The only thing I did differently was to drain and rinse the canned beans but, other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. It couldn't have been tastier.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;cheri;3;I followed the recipe exactly and unfortunately I was disappointed with this soup. It didn't have good flavor. It is healthy for sure and I really appreciated that, but I won't be making this again. It just lacked flavor.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;joy1982;5;"Excellent soup! It has a great thick stew-like consistency thanks to the pureeing step (genius). This could definitely be ""meat-ified"" with ham, chicken, or sausage for those of you with men in your lives, but I liked it just how it was in all its veggie glory. Make sure you have some crusty bread on hand to dip in it and I loved the addition of some crumbles of goat cheese on top, but parmesan is also great. I added a few sliced carrots and loved them in the soup, but I didn't care for the tomatoes too much. I was more liberal with the spices than called for and since I like food with bold flavors, I also added a dash of red pepper flakes and a couple of bay leaves (I think they improve any soup). Make this on a cold day for instant healthy comfort on a spoon."
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kathyholcomb;4;I've been making a version of this soup for quite awhile. I don't use onion as we don't care for it but I add two finely chopped shallots.. I used two cans of rotelli tomatoes with peppers and don't use the Italian herb seasoning. I only use 2 cloves of garlic. I add 2 tsps of light brown sugar, one bay leaf and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes. W like it so well that we have this soup about every two weeks.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;meredith;5;"This soup is a revelation. I wanted to try kale, and this is an easy way to get started. Blending some of the beans gave the soup a wonderful texture; this is a trick I'll use in other soups in the future too. I read some of the reviews that said it was bland -- not so! I like things very flavorful and I thought this was fine. I did add a little lemon juice at the end, and cut the italian seasoning in half per other reviewers' recommendation. I will make this again--soon!"
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;joellanotte;2;Although this recipe was very easy to make and exceptionally healthy, I found it to be very bland.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;susans;5;Excellent! Delicious use of kale (a superfood!)
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;reneegilinger;5;What a great easy recipe, already made it twice in 2 weeks. Added lemon juice before serving and used herbs de provence, both from other reviews and because we really like lemon in soup and I don't really like oregano. Used one can cannellini and one garbanzo second time - can't really say I liked one better than the other. Also used a can of diced tomatoes to save time and that was just fine. So glad to have this one!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;krystalkai6986;4;I made this soup because my bf and i are trying to be healthier and are on a kale fix. It's actually pretty delicious for a healthy soup. I wish I listened to previous reviewers and cut the Italian Herb seasoning to half, it was a little overpowering. Enjoy! :)
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kccat;4;This is such a hearty soup! I'm not typically a lightweight eater, but this soup filled me up. I did make some modifications but not enough to where it ruined the integrity of the soup. I used 5 garlic cloves instead of the 8. Used red kidney beans and black beans because it's what I had on hand, and used a can of diced tomatoes with italian seasoning. I also didn't blend the soup with the beans. I don't mind a thin soup. Oh I also added some beer to it, mostly because it needed more liquid, I didn't have anymore broth and it's what I was drinking at the moment.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;erikab;5;My husband and I loved this healthy recipe! I added red pepper flakes for some zing. For those who need some meat in their soup, I cooked up Italian chicken sausage and meatballs on the side and let people add them to their soup bowls if they wanted. Yum!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;anjackson;4;Very yummy soup...love pretty much any soup with beans and I had some kale to use up, so wanted to give this one a try! I used a can each of chick peas and white kidney beans as they were all I had. Subbed the Italian herbs for Herbes de Provence and added in some crushed chili flakes for a kick :) Great soup for lunch or dinner - wonderful for leftovers too!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kirstengrace;5;MMMM....so good and simple...I substituted 1 can of black beans for the 1 can of white beans...quite versatile
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;hilarybear;5;This is such a great recipe. I used a can of mixed beans and that was really good. I didn't have any fresh tomatoes but I did have some leftover stewed tomatoes that were spiced with cumin and some chilis so I threw that in and hoped for the best. It actually worked out really well. It's good with a bit of a kick! Add some noodles, and you have a sort of minestrone (at least that's what it reminded me of). This is a keeper!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;pratherwife;5;love this recipie thank you! i had to make a few changes so i could use up what i had on hand. I used one can of kidney beans and one can of garbonzo beans. 1 can of stewed tomatos. i added onion powder, garlic powder, a smidge of chili powder, and 1 bay leaf, then added orageno, and basil. (didnt have italian seasoning). came out great! was very easy to make. thanks again!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;ethel;4;I made this soup pretty much the way it was written although I did use Herbes de Provence as I didn't have Italian seasoning. I felt that it needed more oomph, so I added oregano and cayenne as another reviewer suggested. I still felt that it lacked heartiness and the tomato flavors were lost. Finally, I added most of a 6 oz can of tomato paste. It was just what this soup needed to make it a hearty, tasty and healthy meal! I did cook it much longer than indicated, mostly because my husband was late getting home. Thanks for the recie!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;megan713;5;This is delicious! I had leftover kale from a different recipe and had to find a way to use it. What a way! What I did differently was to add a package of Italian chicken sausage, diced. I sauteed the sausage with the onions and garlic. Because the sausage took up a lot of space, it didn't look soupy enough, so I added an additional cup of broth. I didn't have fresh tomatoes on hand so I used a can of diced tomatoes (undrained) and only had one can of cannellini beans, so I used adzuki beans for the rest. I also followed the advice of another reviewer and simmered for 15 minutes uncovered followed by 20 minutes covered. I will be making this again and again. Huge hit here with my 4 kids who usually won't touch soup, let alone kale!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;patti;5;Made this today for the first time. Used veggie broth, 2 cans of small white beans and pureed 3/4 can of chick peas to thicken. No tomatoes but added one tbs of tomato paste. Used italian spice that had quite a bit of rosemary which goes well with kale. I sauteed onins and added kale to pan to steam the night before. The nextday I made recipe and cooked soup for an hour on low. Kale was so tender. A huge hit!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;student;3;Could not get any flavor from this as directed. I would thoroughly cook and season the kale and then add it.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;northernexposure;4;I substituted a 32 oz. can of Muir Glenn organic diced tomatoes (drained) for the fresh plum tomatoes. Came out great.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;sally;5;I just made this soup for lunch and it is wonderful! I cut back on the garlic and didn't have fresh parsley. I'm thinking about having it for dinner also. It is even better with a little fresh grated parmesean cheese on top.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;katieland;4;I love this soup. Honestly it doesnt look appetizing lol, but it's so delicious! And healthy. I didn't need to make any changes at all :)
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;scottfamily;5;I love this soup. I have made it from fresh kale and from greens that I had sauteed and frozen, and it is so good each way. I've also made it from canned beans and tomatoes and from soaked dried beans and fresh tomatoes. The flavor is great and it is hearty and filling. Sometimes I add meatballs for my meat-loving husband and children, but it is equally good without.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;simplysarah;5;FANTASTIC! So flavorful!! I used 1 can garbanzos and 1 can kidney and the flavor contrast was perfect. I also doubled the kale and added extra water.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;sweetbea;5;This soup was so good! Healthy for you too. I highly recommed this soup if you want a low fat and satisfying meal.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jenjen41683;4;This was good, though it got saltier as it sat. I don't know if this is the result of the type of stock I used or if it was something else. But it was delicious! We used a homemade can of tomatoes rather than chopped fresh. Even my husband who claims not to like kale enjoyed this. great with some crusty bread! Thanks!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;erozman;5;wonderful!!! this is my new favorite soup. My only addition was fresh parmesan cheese on top. Also, I never used a food processor or blended and it was delicious!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;manorbooks;3;I was very disappointed in this soup! I feel like I wasted the ingredients overall. WAY TO MUCH garlic and Italian seasoning. No depth of flavor. Kale was no asset, spinach would be much better. I won't be making this again.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;julie0469;5;Excellent. I added ham but next I will do this dish meatless...
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;resendes;4;TASTY N HEALTHY!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;itsanewday;5;This is very good. I did not plan on liking it because I love Zuppa Toscana which this is close to but without the potatoes and cream. And I'm not a fan of cooked tomatoes. I really liked this soup! I added a 1/2 pound of homemade Italian sausage and a pinch of red pepper flakes. I also used fresh spinach instead of kale. I will be making this again. Yum!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;percyleeowen;5;I loved this, but it did take me a while to get the seasonings up to snuff at the end. Probably because I use sodium-free broth. So, after about a teaspoon of bacon salt and a teaspoon of garlic/wine seasoning and a bunch of plain salt plus two teaspoons of vinegar. It tasted delicious!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;norcalmom;3;This soup was ok. It tasted kind of spicy to me, I added more beans than called for because it seemed like there wasn't enough substance in it. I loved the kale in it, just wasn't crazy about the soup in general.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lynnkline;5;Absolutely delicious!! I added 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breast. Made 4 adult sized servings. Next time I will double the recipe so we can have left overs, and will probably rinse 1 can of beans and use 1 cup water in place of chicken stock to cut down on the salt.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;earthmother61;5;Loved it! Didn't have the cheese rind but added shredded before serving.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;joy;5;Yummy! Perfect for a chilly fall day. I added about a pound of chicken sausage. Great way to use kale!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;cbeaver;5;Great soup! I added a little zucchini, lemon juice, and some red pepper flakes. So good for such a healthy soup!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jrubino;5;I added 2 lbs of spicy Italian Sausage and substituted Good Season's Garlic and Herb instead of Italian seasoning.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;cupspinner;5;"I loved this soup. The seasonings were just right. I did add 1 T. tomato paste, because I was using a ""less meaty"" type of fresh tomato. And, wow, 7.3 grams of fiber and 11 grams of protein per serving, based on 8 servings per recipe. What a healthy soup."
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;brightpurple;5;I have to substitute 8 oz tomato sauce due to the fact I didn't have any plum tomatoes. Everything else was as is. Magnifico! Thank you for sharing.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;clarissaspehl;5;"My four year old said ""You sure do make some good soup, Mommy."" Um, yeah, totally going into the recipe box! I subbed out mustard greens since my husband doesn't like kale and added a little extra garlic (we prefer ALOT in this family and no recipe seems to have enough). I used fresh cherry tomatoes since I had some in the garden but they did not add as much acidity as I would have liked. The one out of the ordinary thing I did was that I did not realize my cans were 19 ounces. Pretty yummy so I think I won't worry about the size next time, either."
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;foodchannellover;5;Great soup! Really enjoyed this. Didn't change a thing in the recipe.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mani96;4;This soup is fantastic and I will make it again and again. Here's what I changed and what I would change in the future: I doubled the kale (I had a LOT that I was trying to use up), and it turned out great. I would probably add some type of sweetener because it tasted a skosh acidic/sour with all those wonderful tomatoes in it. Or, I would use fresher sweeter tomatoes from the garden rather than store-bought.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;sophia;5;I loved this. Much more than I thought I would. My kids liked the broth, but not to fond of the kale. I may try with spinach added at the end. Really good-this is one I will make again. Really easy too.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;shrimplady;5;This is a great recipe and should definitely be doubled! It seemed like it needed a little extra acidity to it, so I added the juice and zest of one lemon (for a doubled recipe). Also used canned diced tomatoes and great northern white beans (prepped from scratch). It's a great way to use the fresh kale from the garden! I highly recommend this recipe.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;cairievirrueta;5;A family favorite! And we have all different tastes. I used bouillon cubes/water in place of broth, but followed the recipe exactly. Definitely a keeper!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;happypup;5;My husband wanted a bean soup and he absolutely loved this. Not your typical heavy bean soup recipe. The only change I made was I used swiss chard instead of kale since that's what was on hand and it was great.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;amiddl;4;Really good basic soup. Kept it vegan. Added chick peas but will play around with black-eyed and cannellini. Even with homemade veggie stock, it tasted good. Nice way to start the fall season.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;threeholein1s;5;Well, I made it just a bit less healthy, and added some italian sausage, that I pre-cooked & drained before adding to the soup during the last stages. It is super, but a tad salty, so don't add any additional salt if you decide to use the sausage. It's super without the sausage too!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;sgrmag574;4;Made the recipe as-is. Very tastey and freezes well.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lloydblackmon;5;Made this last night for dinner as written. Simple soup to make. Wife and I both thought it was excellent!. Next time I'll try some variations such as adding collard or mustard greens, garbanzo beans, etc.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;danahowellmelton;4;VERY good. I did as one of the reviewers recommended and did about 15 min in the pressure cooker to meld the flavors, and it came out great. I only wished I'd made some old fashion, salty cornbread to go under this dish. It would have been the perfect compliment to this wonderful veggie stew.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lizsavage;5;"I used chicken broth, a leek instead of the yellow onion and ""pulsed"" my kale in the food processor instead of chopping it larger. The soup was incredibly good. I would absolutely make it again, especially since Kale is one of the top foods you can eat nutritionally. Wish I hadn't waited to try it so long!"
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;gazelavin;4;I have tried this recipe as is and it was pretty good. Definitely not something you will feel bad about after you eat it. However, I am a full blooded Portuguese female so I made this recipe a little more authentic the second time around. I used a cup of crushed canned tomatoes in place of the plum tomatoes, kidney beans in place of the white beans, and also threw in a couple of cubed potatoes, a hand full of orzo and added a little acidity with a splash of vinegar. I would definitely recommend this version if you are a person who like flavor and wants something a little more filling. Otherwise, the original version above is a very simple/healthy yet yummy soup :)
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;tsharadin;5;"Quick; tasty; made it with broth from chickens I smoked; added 1/2 tsp Nevis hot sauce - keeper!"
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jessica;5;This soup was so yummy! It tasted like something they would serve up on the soup menu at Olive Garden. I should've made bread to go with this though because its so low-cal that we were starving an hour later!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kae;5;We loved it (even my six year old daughter)! A great way for my micro-family to try kale for the first time. I used garbanzo beans because we love them so much, canned tomatoes as others have noted, and added a carrot. I also took the advice of previous reviewers: chop kale finely (really fine!), simmer uncovered for 15 min or more to concentrate flavor, and add a squeeze of fresh lemon to serve. Keep the pepper low and leave out parsley for the kiddos, and I also used less garlic (4 cloves not 8) and less onion (1/2 instead of a whole one). Still turned out very flavorful.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jbooshey;2;I was not into this at all. The kale was too chunky and the soup too boring. The garlic flavored up the broth a good amount, but the soup just didn't excite either of us.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;sandradiff;5;Delicious, good for you, soup! I made no changes and we loved it. It only made about 4 - 5 bowls of soup so I would double it next time.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;pama;5;Loved this soup. Trying to incorporate more kale into our diet and this did the trick. Healthy and yummy.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jennipupu;5;easy peasy!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jennifero;4;I needed to cook this soup much longer than suggested for it to develop a really good flavor, but eventually it turned out nice and flavorful. I added some little round noodles and also more veggies like carrots, broccoli, and celery. This made for a really hearty soup.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lainey;5;Absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe exactly as written, and wouldn't change anything. So nice to have a tasty soup which is healthful as well.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;rich;5;delicious, nutritious, and a very satisfying meal for my diet.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kcrown;3;This had way too strong of an Italian Seasoning taste. Next time I would only use 1 teaspoon.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;danandalison;5;Really good, for being so darn healthy!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mgzesati;4;"We really enjoyed this soup. I added soy sausage to add a ""meaty"" taste!"
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kathleen;3;Not to bad. Everyone ate it, but the leftovers went to waste.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;tylersrulz;5;This is a terrific recipe! Delicious! The co-op keeps delivering kale, so a new recipe was more than welcomed! I followed the recipe as written, and it turned out perfectly! Thank you for sharing it!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lmorsi;5;Fast and yummy. I was running low on garlic so I added some garlic powder too and it tasted great. Looking forward to trying it again with 8 LARGE cloves of garlic.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kkbarnhill;3;Flavor was good, but the kale needed to be chopped smaller than I chopped it (I just roughly chopped). The contrast between the pieces of somewhat chewy kale and the more delicate broth was too much. Next time I would cut the kale into tiny pieces and possibly blend more of the beans to create a thicker base.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kbrown9;5;This was FANTASTIC!!! My 3yo and my husband devoured it! I made a few changes to suit our preferences, but it would be good as written. I cooked 6 slices of bacon and used the reserved drippings to saute the onion, garlic and kale in. I used 1 can of tomatoes. I used fresh/rehydrated beans and skipped the puree step. I cooked it all in the crockpot on low for 6 hours and squeezed lemon over it to serve. So good!!! the kale was tender and the bacon gave it some smoke (and credibility for my carnivore husband :)
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;ranae;5;I made this soup last night, and it was awesome! I was surprised at how flavorful it was. One adjustment -- I didn't have enough plum tomatoes in the house, so I added a can of Rotel diced tomatoes with jalapenos instead. It tasted great and has a bit of heat to it. We will definitely be making this again.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;gretchen;5;One of the best soups I've ever tasted! Even better when you use pre-cooked dried navy beans instead of canned. Also, kale is supposed to be one of the top- ten foods for women, so I've read.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;dawn;5;I gave this 5 stars but would have given it 10 if I could. This soup is amazing! I added some of my homemade mini turkey meatballs for some added protein. Other that I followed it to a T and it was AWESOME! Super healthy too...gotta love that! Thank you for sharing.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;gingercat1;5;A tasty and easy-to-make soup. I used chick peas instead of beans, didn't bother to puree and it was great! I've never used kale before, and followed the advice to chop it small. I also cut out the stems. I made it vegetarian & vegan by using my favourite boullion cubes instead of chicken broth. It was really good and I'll definitely make this soup (and use kale) again.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;brownie;5;Easy to do it and delicious, I didn't have a white beans instead I used red beans, and I included the chicken breast (the organic one)from the chicken broth I make. For seasoning just oregano and Celtic Sea Salt. It came out surprinsingly flavorous!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;rex;5;Freaking GOOD. Add sausage.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;chefmikki;5;This was really a good surprise. So easy to prepare and tasting. I only had one jar of cannellini beans so I pureed that with the broth and for the other can I used garbanzo.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;sheilap1;4;Delicious. As other reviewers have mentioned, be sure to chop the kale fine as it is a fairly tough green, and I also cooked it longer, again because it was still tough after 15 minutes. It did lose it's beautiful bright green colour but at least it was softer. Flavour of this soup is fantastic. I used white kidney beans as I couldn't find the ones asked for. Worked great.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;fatimae;4;Very nice, light and healthy soup. I used garbanzos and diced potatoes because I didn't have white beans at hand.

e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;j9;5;My soup lacked pizzazz, but then I played around with the ingredients a lot, and it wouldn't be honest to give it a lower rating. However, I want to share this useful tip: DON'T THROW OUT THE KALE STALKS! Rather, chop them up into small pieces and sauté them with the onions.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;liz;5;I had never tried kale but love exploring new recipes and new foods. This soup is awesome! Even bf who is not adventurous in dining (pure meat and potatoes man) had two servings and was shocked himself. I followed the recipe as written, did not change a thing.

e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;elizabeth;5;Great healthy recipe. I used vegetable stock to keep it vegan, added an extra can of beans and I used a can of diced tomatoes and it was fabulous. Its a beautiful soup and it tastes great. My family would never eat kale normally but they loved this.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jennifer;5;I have never had Kale before but wow this recipe was amazing. My husband that likes steak and potatoes really liked this. I did not have any tomatoes and the next time I make this I will not add the tomatoes, why ruin perfection!! I used navy beans and cannellini beans. Enjoy
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;omie;5;This was delicious! Simple and quick to make. No need to add anything else...hearty enough.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;sandwich;5;Perfect! My husband and I loved this soup! Very quick and simple!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mcbacon;5;This is delicious! My whole family enjoyed this. I didn't add tomatoes or parsley, but even without them, this soup is a keeper for us!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mollybennett;5;Awesome!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lamaha;5;Delicious. I made mine with 1 can of navy beans, and 1 can of cannellini beans (aka white kidney beans). Also, I used beans that had no added salt. It was really delicious. Will definitely make again.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;cherbear;5;I made this soup exactly as written and it was fabulous. My husband and I sprinkled shredded cheese and crushed red pepper on top.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;melodee;5;wow this was good. I chopped the kale really small and just substituted some garlic powder, basil and oregano for the italian herb seasoning. After sauteeing the garlic, onions and kale, I just put everything into the pot and after it was done simmering (I let it simmer about 45 minutes) I pureed it all. I skipped the parsley (didn't need it) and sopped my bowl of soup with crusty bread. YUM!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kristanhoadleyblair;5;Great soup! My husband liked it better with some red chili flakes, and I have to admit a little spice made it just a little bit better. Thanks for the recipe!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;cafeman;5;I loved this recipe even though my wife did not like it that much.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;taboo0914;3;Could have done without the Italian herb seasoning I think. Also, I had to kick up the chicken broth by adding chicken bullion.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;roseann13;5;Love it, very tasty, very versatile!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jenray;5;Great recipe! Thank You...
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;spyseoflife;5;Great Soup...I loved it!!!! very easy to make
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;gibnenykaren;5;I love this soup. It's healthy and simple to make. I used 1 can of diced tomatoes and added a little basil and oregano. I also grated pecorino romano cheese to the soup in my bowl and it was perfect.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;slj6;5;So good and so healthy! I used way more kale so I increased the amount of chicken broth. Otherwise did not change a thing. Served with some percorino romano and red hot pepper flakes sprinkled on top. Delicious!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;amy314;5;Fantastic. Made it twice so far, following the recipe almost exactly (I used cherry/grape tomatoes that I had from the garden, and ran them through the food processor.) I also used 2C homemade chicken broth, and 2 boullion cubes. It's perfect as a meal if served with good bread. I'd also recommend melting a slice of Swiss cheese on top, if you want to make it fancy.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;crazy4sushi;4;A good, healthy soup that is pretty filling. Reminds me of a minestrone. I doubled the kale and used canned diced tomatoes. I added some red pepper flakes to give it a little kick.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;alicat;5;Yum! I have made a lot of different soups with a white bean and kale base, and loved the idea of blending some of the beans to give it a creamy look... And it was amazing & froze well. Great soup- we will definitely make again.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;runnermom04;5;With an abundance of frozen kale from past years gardens I was looking for something to do with it. This was perfect! Easy, fast and tasty!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mel1218;5;This is a great and healthy soup. Like others, I used canned diced tomatoes. Instead of mixing a cup of broth with the beans to puree I just used a dash of it, I like the extra thickness, but that is a matter of personal taste. I also put a sprinkle of grated cheese when serving the soup and cut up a carrot and threw that in with the kale while sauteeing. This soup also freezes well, I live alone and make the big pot and freeze it in individual servings, and just take when out when I need something quick and healthy to eat.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;tiffanyphillips;4;Easy and good. I made as directed and tasted - it was yummy (I love all the garlic in it!), but I was wanting a bit more of a tomato flavor so I added a small can of tomato paste and a pinch of cayenne. Its not pretty, but tastes yummy and makes you feel healthy eating it! I may add an extra cup of kale next time and maybe a bit of potato. I cant wait for winter as I bet it tastes even better on a cold, snowy day!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mommy;5;love this. quick easy soup made with kale. my kids even eat it!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;rlscs;5;I have never liked kale until I tried this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly. It was easy to make. I LOVED it! Even my husband, who has taste buds which are difficult to please, said it was outstanding!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;eddie;4;Very good. I changed a few things. For one, I made much less. I also didn't use tomatoes, and i cooked it a bit longer though on a lower heat. I also added a little heat because I like spicy. And, I used a little bit more kale- since I like it much. Either way, very good!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;amore;5;mmm mm mmmm... I never had kale before recent but my CSA gives us tons every week and this is my favorite recipe to use it in! I also added a zucchini and some fresh thyme. I didn't have Italian seasoning so I just used oregano and basil instead (Italian enough for me!). quite delicious, thank you! :)
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;ctyler;4;I added a pound of browned, drained Italian sausage - good addition. Also increased the Italian herb seasonings to 1Tbs
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;junglepeachpie;5;Great basic kale and bean soup. I added extra liquid because I added elbow pasta in the last 7 minutes to make it more substantial. I also sauteed my onions for a few minutes before adding the garlic.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;bunnyboots;5;Loved it! I only had canned black beans (just fine) and canned tomatoes. This is flavorful and I feel like I am getting lots of good nutrients. Now, I know what to do with Kale.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;karynandrea;4;Followed recipe as listed except used dried oregano in place of italian herbs and added a touch of fresh dill. Also added some pasta at the request of my hubby. This basically tasted like a typical minestrone soup with the addition of kale, so we both liked it.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;maryb;5;Loved it, Loved it. My husband, who does not shop much picked up the greens for salad as I asked him to, however, he came home with kale. I have never used kale, but the conservative person that I am, I never waste anything. Found this recipe. I made a double batch adding canned tomatoes with peppers and onion and used red onion because didn't have yellow. Will absolutely make again and experiment with other ingredients as the other wonderful cooks have done in the reviews. Great low cal recipe. Thank You. PS: My diabetic friend loved it too.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;carrie6;5;"First time using kale. I added cubed potatoes and carrots with the garlic and onion. Simmered about 30 minutes and served with fresh bread. A meal in its self; my whole family loved it!"
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;universitycook;4;So good! Added canned white chicken after shredding it in the food processor (before adding the broth-bean mixture) for some meat in the mix. Great recipe!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;tziviajennifermacleod;5;Absolutely delicious! I used fresh Italian herbs from the garden - oregano, thyme and basil - to complement the fresh garden kale. The family was dreading eating the kale, but served with a fresh crusty no-knead bread, this was an easy filling supper!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;angelapenny;5;Delicious~~~~My family loves this soup so much I make it every month. Sometimes I add chicken.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;guapa10;4;Excellent base soup. didn't change a thing. I did add cubed tofu though, worked well. Next time I would omit the italian seasoning and add just oregano.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;angel;5;Can't wait for a cool day to make again. I did let it simmer all day so the ribbs in the kale would soften more. Next time, I believe I would like to cut the kale in ribbons because I like tons of it in my soup! Thank you so much, I loved this recipe!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;danaturner;5;This is my favorite soup! I do make one major change though and it's that I add ham. The ham lends awesome flavor to it. I don't add the tomato but instead add some carrot slivers and sometimes potato.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;flutterby62;5;LOVE IT! My hubby and I really love this soup. I am now making doubles batches and we eat thru out the week. Added a teaspoon of white pepper for a little extra kick. Yummy.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;bigjesse;5;Snot too bad -Big Jesse
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;rhenry;5;Simple and delicious! Made as written and we loved it, sauteed some chicken sausage on the side and added in after to make it heartier....thank you!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;smartfishies;5;Delicious AND heathy!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lawsy1;5;Really good! My first time for trying kale and I was pleasantly surprised. My changes: can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh, used chicken broth, just had to add some polish sausage, but it would have been just as good without meat. I will definitely make this again.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lynniep;5;I cooked a lb of ground turkey with the onions and garlic, followed everything else exactly. Such a hearty soup for a rainy day - it was delicious!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;catie;5;This is a great base recipe to add to/alter. I added potatoes and more carrots, to personal taste. Would also be yummy with italian sausage, or sweet potatoes, or corn, or green beans...
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kmarie;5;Yum! Although, I realized as I was making it that I had used vegetable stock and not chicken, but I don't think it mattered much. A great low-fat soup that still fills you up.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;ccrowley;5;This is very good. I used 1 can diced tomatoes instead of plum tomatoes, I didn't use parsley, and I added 1 boneless, skinless chicken breast cut in cubes and sauteed. Delicious!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;ccrowley;5;This is very good. I used 1 can diced tomatoes instead of plum tomatoes, I didn't use parsley, and I added 1 boneless, skinless chicken breast cut in cubes and sauteed. Delicious!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;fbastorga;5;I love this soup! I added diced chicken breast and I did not put the left over ingredients in the food processor!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;molle888;4;This was SUCH a delicious soup after my modifications (the four stars are for the original recipe). I added carrots, celery and a potato. I also added some red pepper flakes for kick. I ended up simmering this for 30 minutes so that the kale got nice and soft. My boyfriend and I almost finished the entire pot I made last night by noon today!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;carlyhoo;5;Loved it... used half garlic because of my 5 year old but will used the full amount next time. Also used canned tomatoes with italian seasoning since the tomatoes didn't look appealing. Not a fan of kale but this was delicious!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;twolf;5;great yummy soup
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;messycook;5;We loved this soup. Definently a meal not just a soup. Only modification I made was to add spicy italian sausage (turkey). Can't wait to make it again.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;sueb;5;I used this as a springboard to making a delicious soup! I used chopped beet greens and some garbanzo beans. Instead of tomatoes, I used crushed tomatoes. This was so good and satisfying!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;cjucoder;5;"This is amazing soup. I kept making ""nummy"" noises as I ate it. The only changes I made was to add some kielbasa; 2 hot-dog sized links that were chopped pretty finely. I also used one can of diced tomato instead of the plum tomatoes. Used mostly red kale since the regular green kale in my supermarket was not in good shape. I think this could use a third can of white beans. Make sure the kale is nice and tender before adding the whole beans, because the beans will break down pretty quickly and you want some whole beans for texture and flavor. Boy I loved this after being snowed in yesterday. Delicious. Thanks for an exquisite recipe."
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;molly;5;Healthy and delicious! Word of advice, make sure that the Kale is chopped well!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;snowbuddy;5;"My new favorite soup. This soup is flavorful and delicious. I made the recipe exact, except: used a high quality expensive olive oil (so tasty), couldn't find plum tomatoes so used 9 cherry tomatoes sliced in half; and I cooked my own white beans with a pinch of salt, and toward the end a few sprinkles of cayenne. Everything organic. Amazing! Thank you so much for this delightful use of Kale!!"
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jmw;4;I used a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes with chillis for a spicier flavor, and it worked well!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;debmccleary;5;"Yummy soup! Did not have enough beans so added two small chopped potatoes, canned diced tomatoes cuz no fresh, also a grated carrot and finely chopped celery. Husband wanted meat so simmered two whole chicken breasts with all the vege's then chopped chicken small. Very good soup even tho I had to improvise a bit. edit to add- I see many are complaining about the kale not being cooked enough. Cook it alone in olive oil and ""I Can't Believe It's Not Butter"" margarine, ( then check for ""chewiness""). Save until the rest of soup s finished, then add."
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;janetwhite;5;Delicious! I added cooked quinoa to the final soup to make it a little heartier and boost the protein content. Really happy with it.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;femmedivine;5;This soup is super yummy. I made a couple of changes. I did drain the beans and skipped the italian seasoning the second time I made it and replaced that with a bit (1/3 C) of chopped anise (the veggie not the spice). So so good!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;christinaleeper;4;Light and healthy recipe. I really enjoyed the fresh parsley on top - nice finish!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;spunkee83;5;Rave reviews all around! So tasty and nourishing! I made this soup twice - once with 2 cans of canellli beans, and once with 1 can chick peas + 1 can kidney beans. Both are delicious. Instead of plum tomatoes, I used a can of diced tomatoes with oregano and basil - gave the broth some extra savoriness. I'm about to forward this recipe to my mother and my best friend!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;debbbiedoodlenoodle;3;Ok recipe, remind me of escarole and bean soup. Truth is it is hard to make kale taste good. Just don't use too much kale like i did.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;bcmiller;5;I made this twice in one week. The first time I made it strictly vegetarian, I made it after breakfast then heated it back on the stove at dinner. It was very yummy and there were no leftovers. The second time, I made it for my husband & added sausage & chicken broth. He couldn't get enough! Very easy & so nice and healthy with the kale and the beans!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lindabeller;5;Delicious, healthy. What more could you ask?
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;audreyk;4;Great recipe. It would probably be very tasty as is but I did change a few things. First of all I added a hot pepper, 2 carrots and 2 yukon gold potatoes to the onion, kale and garlic and fried those together for about 10 minutes. I mixed the tomatoes and let that cook a while before I added the broth. This mixture I simmered for about 15 minutes before adding the blended mixture. It was spicy and delicious. Next time I will probably add another can of beans to the blender mixture to give it a thicker consistency.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mercedeeez;5;Such a fabulous taste! It was a great & easy way to prepare kale.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;cara0017;5;Very, very good soup! Everybody enjoyed it. I forgot the parsley the second time I made it and thought it was just as good, if not better. (You can taste the kale more without the parsley, in my opinion). Definitely a new favourite! Mium.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;cherylo;5;A new favorite!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;iorion;5;This soup is so fresh and delicious! Plenty of garlic--just my taste! I added some smoked sausage as other reviewers suggested and a little crushed can tomatoe sauce to the broth as I had some left over and it really added to the flavor. My BF always has to eat meat in his meals so the sausage really added some extra heartiness.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;deann;4;This was a great way to use up all the kale we had this year.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;katherine;5;"This soup is really hearty and delicious! I added 6 very thin slices of dried chorizo to the onions and it gave the soup a nice smoky undertone. I also added a 2"" by 3"" parmesan rind while simmering. I would suggest cooking it as long as it takes to really soften the kale. So healthy too!"
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;daniel;5;This was a surprisingly yummy soup. The only thing I changed is I used some home made vegetable stock instead of the chicken stock. Yum!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;wilkie;5;Awesome. Surprisingly hearty and filling! Baby loved it too!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;ashort84;5;Wow so good! I wasn't expecting this dish to have so much flavor. If I did it again, I'd make cornbread to go with it.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;fithealthymom;5;This is a very healthy and delicious soup! I didn't have any fresh parsley, but it turned out excellent anyway.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;patty;2;Did not care for Kale it seemed tough and bitter.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;marian27;5;Don't know what to do with kale? This is it! This delicious, warms-the-soul soup goes very well with cornbread. I feel healthy after eating it! I like the variety of vegetables, which you can substitute for other vegetables you have on hand. (I used a large garden-variety tomato and red onion instead of yellow.)
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;skymaidn;5;This soup was almost impossible to set down and quit eating! High on my list to make again!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;epicure;4;I liked this soup, but one could definitely botch the flavor if nice, ripe tomatoes aren't used. The soup definitely tasted better the second time around because of the acidity from the vine ripened tomatoes. I thought the that the acidity was important enough that I even doubled the amount of tomatoes called for the second time I cook this recipe. This time it turned out very well. I also recommend leaving out some Parmesan cheese for people to add to their soup if desired. It was a nice addition that some people liked.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;rencausley;4;I wanted to use up some kale I had and this was a good way, it was a little bland needed more seasonings but over all this was a good recipe thanks for sharing.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mmacdo10;5;This soup was really good and I am generally not a soup lover! I only had one can of beans so i did not blend any. I also added potato, carrot and fresh basil. Topped it before eating with some parm!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;susan;5;I love homemade soup and this is one you can throw together on a weeknight without much trouble. I agree with some of the other reviewers about the salt. I added 1 tsp. salt and found that I didn't need that much due to the salt from the beans (I used low sodium chicken broth).
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lucysmom;5;WOW! Great recipe! Found myself with a sack of Kale and had no idea what to do with it and found this recipe. The ONLY things I did different was to use canned diced tomatoes with chilies (drained)and used canned Great Northern Beans. The tomatoes with chilies gave it some real kick. Super Recipe!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;nonancolorado;5;I loved this recipe! My husband isn't a fan of Kale but he loved this soup!!!! I didn't change anything in the recipe, followed it to the letter. I will definitely be making this again - thank you for posting this!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;carabiniero8;5;This recipe is amazing! My broth (I used a veggie cube) turned out really well, which I think was the key! My boyfriend who is not in general fond of soups also gave this one rave reviews! The two slight modifications that I made were: 1) used dry beans i/o canned which adds a bit to the prep time for soaking and cooking them, but saves you from having to consume the insanely high amounts of sodium that comes with every can of beans and 2) I made my own Italian seasoning using a recipe from this website and fresh herbs from my garden, which turned out really well and saved about $5-6 in the process. Overall, whoever came up with the idea of pairing kale and beans is a culinary genius, and so is whoever conceived of this recipe!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;karintracy;4;Really yummy. I may have oversalted it a little, but it's still very tasty. I used kale and red chard (had both in my CSA box this week) and a few red potatoes diced. Added a can of fire-roasted tomatoes instead of plum tomatoes. Also added a healthy dash of lemon pepper shortly before serving.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;ricardo;5;Had some Kale that we got through our local C.S.A. and didn't know what to do with it. Stumbled across this recipe and I have made this soup many times since. Excellent!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;ashleysullivan;5;Made this soup because I had kale on hand...It was delicious..I added some extra spices because it was a little bland upon first taste, and used garbanzo beans instead of navy beans. Excellent recipe, simple to make, few ingredients, and easily adaptable to what you have on hand. I will make it again!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;joiep11;5;"I made this last night, and was a little skeptical when I tasted it. It was just okay; a little bland. However, I brought it for lunch today, and after sitting overnight it is MUCH better! I gave it 5 stars for the simple prep, common ingredients, and nutritional value. I recommend not adding any salt until the next day, unless you use ""no salt"" cans of beans."
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kat;5;I was looking for a nice healthy soup that didn't have meat and I found this heavenly piece of work. When i was cooking i wasn't sure if i had enough of kale then onion but then i figured it out on how to do it my way and it came out delicious. I only used half of the medium onion and only 2 regular tomatoes and it was still perfect, even my mom had to let her bf try some and he loved it. I feel proud of myself =D and thank you for submitting such great easy to make and VERY healthy soup.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;elaine222;5;Easy and delicious, always my favorite combo. I also added a can of tomatoes and some bay leaves for a little more flavor. Very tasty.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;dnovgo;5;My husband and I really enjoyed this. It's summer so I have fresh herbs in my garden. Instead of Italian spice, I threw in a large handful of sprigs -- sage, thyme, oregano and rosemary, and let that simmer for the 15 minutes. Delicious!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;thesuze84;5;Over the past couple of years, I've made this soup several times and we never tire of it. So good!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;erock101;5;I made this again ... I don't think it's the best soup every anymore, and I have made way more healthy stuff at this point. But, I still give it 5 stars for ease and convenience, and yummy ingredients. The garlic is on point. 5/27/2009 This is the best soup ever!!! I have never made anything sooooo healthy
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;nicole;5;Very good! I'd never had kale before, so i looked up how to cook it on allrecipes and came across this one. Honestly, i just cooked it cause i had all the ingredients for it on hand but i'm so glad i did! Will definitely make again.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;veggielovinhippie;4;Five stars with chili flakes. I used lentils and it was great that way too.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;alisa;5;Excellent recipe! The kale adds a very satisfying texture to the soup. Tastes even better the next day.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;denverdog;5;I've been making this exact recipe for quite some time now. It is SO good and we never get tired of it. Our favorite!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;becca;5;I looked this recipe up earlier today and made it tonight. It's a family favorite! I took another person's advice and added a little chili powder(maybe a teaspoon) and love it. It reminds me of Zuppa Tuscana, without the fat and calories. I was worried that it wouldn't taste good without meat. I am so glad I didn't add any, it's perfect! Thanks for the recipe.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;bekas;5;Great and healthy recipe! I used veggie broth (why involve meat if you don't have to?) and added some crimini mushrooms I had on hand. Definite winner.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;njmom;5;I did not use tomatoes, but added a small can of V8. i also added a link of chorizo. loved it.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;smb41;5;This was so good that my meat-loving hubby didn't even complain about a meatless meal! A great use for all the kale we've been getting in our CSA box. Used about 1/2 can diced tomatoes (w/out juices) since we didn't have any fresh in the house.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;shay;5;REALLY GOOD!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;susiekew;5;I'm giving this a 5 star recipe, even though my hisband thought it was a 3, and my daughter refused to even taste it, because I absolutely loved it. It is filling, healthy and esy to make, and perfect for me when made with vegetable broth. The only change I made was to omit the parsley at the end. A soup with so much green already doesn't really need it, in my opinion. I served it with freshly grated parmesan at the table for sprinkling, which added a wonderful flavour, and with easy beer bread mix, from this site. Thanks so much!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;squeakychu;5;Great use of kale! Thanks! I made this soup with only a few changes. I couldn't find my Italian seasoning (until the soup was already made and like my soup well spiced), so I added 1 tsp basil, 1 tsp oregano, 1 tsp rosemary, 1/2 tsp thyme, and 1/8 tsp cayenne. Instead of blending, I just used a potato masher to mash the contents of one can of beans and cooked everything together all at once for 20 minutes. It was so easy and tasty that my husband, who said he wasn't hungry, decided to eat two bowls of it! :)
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;amandaboyarshinov;5;Super Easy, filling, healthy and great for families on a budget. I added Bow Tie pasta and topped with fresh grated Parmesan. This way we ate it for 2 meals. My toddler ate a whole bowl!!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;eattolive;5;"Adjustments I made: used 6 oz. red wine in place of same amount of broth; used water because I had no broth; used only 4 cloves garlic instead of 8 and added garlic powder; used 2 T. tomato paste when sauteing onions and garlic; omitted parsley. It came out fabulous and very hearty. Used cayenne instead of red pepper flakes. NOTE: I agree with another reviewer - this made only 4 hearty servings, not 8 when used as a main dish. The second time I made it came out even better. Used one cup white wine (pinot grigio) and 4 cups chicken broth. Drained and rinsed great northern beans prior to using. Omitted parsley and italian seasoning (didn't have any) and used fresh cut up large tomatoes ~ 1 cup and white onions."
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;rodriguezintexas;5;You just don't want the bowl to end! We are vegetarians, so I used a homemade bouillon powder I got from bluedogblog and it turned out just right. (Plus, the nutritional yeast in the bouillon mix added some good protein, vitamins and minerals!) The one thing I must say is that this recipe does NOT feed 8 adults--more like 4 with no seconds. If you eat soup as your main course like my family, plan on doubling it and triple for guests. Thanks, Jean, for the great recipe I will make again and again.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;llr;5;I have made this several times, it is excellent and very healthy. I cut down on the broth and add V8 juice, canned tomatoes, and carrots. I've also added cooked Chicken or Turkey. I've made this for friends recovering from surgery.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jennifer;5;I made this soup tonight just as the recipe reads. It was delicious.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;piggoesmoo;5;Great recipe and easy to make. I added some pasta for a heartier feel to the soup but I'm sure it's still great without it!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;bonniek;5;We love this soup! The second time I made this, instead of fresh tomatoes, I added 2 cans of stewed tomatoes and I really liked the results a lot better.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kms;5;AMAZING!!!!! This was a great soup! I'm on a vegan fast for a month and this soup was perfect. It tasted great! It was healthy! My only change was using a can of diced tomatoes in place of the fresh.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;betabear;4;I was looking for a recipe to use my cannellini beans and kale, this was a great starting point for a very hearty, healthy soup. Thank you.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;melanie;1;I did not care for this.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;residentofq13;5;Wonderful recipe! The only change I made was to add a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes for the fresh ones. I'm really looking forward to tomorrow's leftovers.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kiwioz0708;5;I am trying to eat healthier but without loosing flavor, and this definitely did the job! The only thing i changed in this recipe was the addition of carrots and black olives!I will definitely be making this again in the near future! I will be more patient this time, though and let the soup simmer a lot longer than 15 minutes, though, as suggested by others.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lachef;4;This was delicious - even my carnivorous husband liked it. I did add some chicken to it, and used black beans b/c that was what I had on hand. I added some egg noodles and carrots as well. I pureed half of the black beans and a few of the carrots, and that gave a nice consistency.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;cookinggal;5;This soup was easy and delicious. I have never eaten kale before but could not pass it up on the BOGO sale this week. I added carrots and celery as I wanted to use up these ingredients. I also used dried beans, canned tomatoes, dried parsley, and herbes de provence as I had these ingredients on hand. I added a little garlic salt and a few dashes of hot sauce as I was afraid the soup might taste like kale or be flavorless. As other reviewers have said, it really is good! I had it with 1/2 of a sandwich for lunch and it was very filling.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;chelseas;3;4 stars for the healthy elements in this soup. 2 stars for the absolutely boring taste. I am a vegetarian and normally cook low fat meals but this did not hit the spot. Followed it exactly as written then simmered in a crock pot for 3 hours and blended at the end. I wouldn't spend the time to make this soup again.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;melaniedailey;5;Best bean soup. Ever.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;ejfh;4;I love this soup! I combined this recipe with the Cannelini Bean with Flat Leaf Kale soup. I used chopped turkey kielbasa and a cup of chopped carrots and a can of diced tomatoes for ease. I omitted the onion and used four or five cloves of garlic. I also added a cup of ditalini or other small pasta at the end which I really thought made the soup. I made this for a light post Christmas dinner and everyone loved it.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;micyam;5;I loved this soup! I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh, and it turned out really well. I will definitely make this again.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;litlelisa1;4;Really delicious soup that is very easy to make. I added about 2 cups of vegetarian sausage crumbles, and about a tsp each of cumin and cayenne pepper. Next time I will blend more of the beans for an even thicker stock.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;seeshell;5;Very good! I have made it twice and the second time I added ground pork sausage.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;emily;5;This was so good even my veggie-avoiding husband raved about it. I didn't have onion, but I used fresh Italian parsley for the seasoning and substituted black beans and garbanzo beans instead of white beans. I mashed the garbanzos with a potato masher to keep the consistency a little chunky, and simmered for 45+ minutes on very low heat. It turned out fantastic.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mishi;5;I loved this recipe! The soup is SO good! We are going out of town, so I froze the extra, but I really want to eat more! I used regular tomatoes and added mozzeralla/parmesan cheese on top! Tasty!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;catherineenid;4;this recipe looks boring, but is really tasty did not have white beans, so used pinto beans and increased the kale. The pureed beans makes a really nice base. Easy and yummy.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;allegra;5;My daughter asked if I could eat only one thing for the rest of my life what would it be. This soup is so awesome I chose this. It's healthy and delicious.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;amy;5;Excellent! Ratio of liquid to other ingredients was perfect, and seasoning was well-proportioned. Not an over-powering soup but a comforting mix of flavors.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;anneclaude;5;Delicious and so healthy! I added a chicken breast and simmered for about 1 hour, then shredded it before serving. No leftover!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;carrieh82;5;We loved this simple and delicious soup! My hubby came home from work and immediately asked about the wonderful smell all throughout the house! I followed the recipe very closely, but I did substitute a can of tomatoes for the fresh and added extra kale since I had no fresh parsley available. So yummy! We will be making this for years to come, thanks so much for sharing this recipe!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;valere;5;I loved this soup and so did my guests. It is very fresh tasting. I didn't alter anything. Thank you for the recipe!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;greenie2600;4;I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, and threw a sprig of parsley in the pot while it was cooking, but otherwise left the recipe alone. I used one can of navy beans and one can of cannellini. It's a good, hearty, earthy winter or autumn soup, that practically demands a side of warm, crusty bread with butter. It's a solid, but not exceptional recipe - I'm certainly enjoying the bowl in front of me right now, but I doubt I'll make it again.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lynnantisellspivey;5;thought this was great. excellent way to use kale if you aren't sure if you like it or not.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;marieofromania;5;Very simple and very good. I realized too late that I didn't have any tomatoes, so used a couple tablespoons of tomato paste. Worked out fine. Will make this again!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;delilahm;5;added chicken and made it in the crock pot. It was great.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;veggiegreengirl;4;I wasn't too crazy about this but it was a great healthy and very filling soup. I'm not that fond of kale but it was easy to make an had lots of flavor. If you like kale, this recipe is for you! If you don't it is still pretty good. I would suggest using a larger white bean and not navy beans, they were too small and they kinda lost their shape in my soup.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;tynheids;5;This was very easy to make and so tasty. My husband doesn't like kale and he loved it. The tomatoes were a very nice touch. I added carrots and celery just for more veggies and simmered the soup a little longer than called for so the kale would be more tender. This is definitely a keeper and will be regular in my family. Thank you for sharing!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;snowflake;5;Absolutely wonderful soup! I used fresh chicken stock though and rather than lug out the food processor, I simply mashed the canned beans with a potato masher (sure saves on clean-up). Will keep this recipe for another time! YUM!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;amyamanda;4;"I just made this recipe and it was great! I used canned tomatoes because the ""fresh"" tomatoes at the store didn't look so fresh. I also used Herbes de Provence because I was out of Italian seasoning, and I threw in carrots because I read other reviews and it seemed like a good idea. Those were my initial changes, but when I gave the soup a taste, it needed something. After some thought, I poured in what I estimate to be 2-3 tablespoons of lemon juice and voila! Success! I also added a bit of garlic salt, but I think I only had to do that because I used a low sodium veggie broth (small note: Imagine organic veggie broth is a favorite of mine, but I'm not a fan of the low sodium version - it's less flavorful all around). I cooked the soup longer because the toughness of kale bugs me a little and I wanted it to be good and tender. In the end, what my fiance and I wound up eating was absolutely wonderful. We might do it in a crockpot next time - which will be soon!"
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;violetzee;4;It must be fall. I'm seeking out soup recipes and this is a must! Great use of kale. Freezes very well! Thank you.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;pinkypink;5;Okay, I've made a lot of soup recipes from this site, as well as kale recipes too. I think this one can easily top them in both categories. I had fresh onions, kale, and parsley from my mom's garden so I decided to whip it up. I halved the recipe but kept the broth the same. It was the easiest, simplest and healthiest soup I've ever had! The kale tasted amazing!!!! It wasn't tough or rubbery. The only thing I did was to cook it for longer (about 1.5 hours on low). I like my soups to be cooked slow and simmering. Will keep making over and over.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;abcdefgh;5;I love this soup! It is good comfort food. The next day it is much tastier. Cooking dry beans in advance and/or making the broth from scratch REALLY paid off in terms of flavor with this recipe.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;teresachaffee;4;Looking for a use of Kale, found this recipe quite good. I used canned tomatoes for simplicity and added cayenne pepper & garlic salt for added flavor. Also used 1 can Great Northern beans for soup base and used 1 can vegetarian beans & 1 cup broth blended to thicken soup. Still looking for more zest or flavor, I then added 1 can of Hot Chili Beans. Good recipe!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kate;5;Great recipe. I usually add carrots, potatoes and elbow pasta.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;spearl20;4;This is a good recipe, but I would use a little less broth and more water, such as three cups broth and one water-- like another reviewer stated. I threw in some whole wheat pasta and romano cheese.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;sandy;5;Super easy and packed with flavor---a real hit!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;heididugan;5;This was wonderful! I'm suffering from a headcold and my husband generously dug into this week's CSA bag when I found this recipe. He whipped up this soup and my generally veggie-hating kids gobbled it up. He had a third helping. The wonderful flavors and aromas even dented my clogged head. Wonderful recipe! A definite keeper!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;thomasjenkins;5;This is Delicious. The second time I omitted tomatoes, Italian seasoning, & Parsley and added smoked sausage and diced potato. Very good also.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;cguest29;5;Good soup. I have a soup fascination as it is, but this one is good for you too. I used tomato sauce and some leftover marinara sauce from the Italian resturant instead of the tomatoes. Pretty good too for the certain national diet program I am on , not too many points:)
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jennifer;4;It was only ok the first day, but it improved a lot with time, as the flavors blended. It's a great way to use kale though, and so healthy!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;shun;5;Delicious!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;devolution587;5;I love this soup. It is so healthy and flavorful. Kale might discourage some from making this, but I assure you that you'll be glad if you do. Kale is a popular staple at local farmer's markets here in Seattle. It is full of fiber and nutrients. I top this soup with parmesan cheese and sometimes add an extra can of mashed canellini beans for extra creaminess. Thanks for a great recipe!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;milehighme;5;This soup is fabulous and I make a new batch at least 2 or 3 times a month. Even the meat-and-potatoes boyfriend finds this supremely satisfying when served with some savory muffins. Even though we're garlic lovers, I cut the amount of garlic in half and added 3 or 4 sliced carrots. I use a can of diced tomatoes instead of the romas, and as another reviewer suggested, Herbes de Provence instead of Italian seasoning -- gives it a very sophisticated flavor. Sublime!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jaylynnestuart;5;What? Only 5 stars possible? I made this a while back, but I'm having the last of my frozen leftovers tonight. This is AWESOME! It's quick and easy and so tasty and filling! I made it at the height of a nationwide tomato recall, so I used a can of diced tomatoes...spectacular! Due to my mood that day, and the availability of hot smoked sausage in my freezer, I added about 1/3 lb of it thinly sliced before I sauteed the onion. I also added three thinly sliced carrots, just because I am a carrot addict and you can't have too many veggies. I hate when people completely change a recipe, but those were the only changes I made and I can tell that it would have been great without them. The only downside to my batch of soup was NOT due to the recipe, but due to my laziness when it came to chopping the kale. I left it too big to be spoon friendly. Just letting others know this so they will chop their kale well. Yummy, yummy, yummy, and thank you for this recipe! LOVE IT!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;carolynbrown;5;I made this with only one can of beans and two tomatoes (everything else as written). The whole family loved it and my husband was surprised that there was no meat. I'm very happy to have another good recipe with kale.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;cardamum;4;Good, a very hearty soup. I'd probably add more broth in the future. Thanks for the recipe!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;celiecancook;5;My changes: Used less garlic (about 4 cloves), used great northern beans and canned diced tomatoes because I had them on hand. I also added diced turkey smoked sausage and sauteed it with the onions, garlic and also some grated carrots. My changes were based on what I hand on hand and to meet my personal preferences, but I think this would be a great recipe even with no changes.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;natalie;4;This was really tasty. The only changes/additions I made were: using vegetable broth instead of chicken, a little cayenne & fresh chopped basil. I also simmered the soup (with lid on) for almost an hour to really meld the flavors.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;thatisso8;5;Thank you so much for this recipe! We just got our first shipment of veggies from our local CSA and I had never cooked with collard greens before. I was actually confused and thought they were kale so I used them in this recipe -- but the results were delicious! Great for dinner and the leftovers were yummy too!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;erinalexis20;5;MMMM MMM MMM! This is the first time I've ever tried kale--too everyone's advice and simmered for 10 min w/ lid off and 20 min w/lid on. The kale is so tender and I used a can of stewed italian tomatoes. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a T! SO much better than I thought it would be and I'll be sure to make this again! Diet friendly too! Thanks for sharing it!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;amykeefewerking;5;Yum! Filling and easy.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;carolm;5;Great soup! I didn't puree it and added a can of petite diced tomatoes instead of the plum tomatoes. Really enjoyed it.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jessica;5;This is excellent soup! I didn't follow the recipe exactly (didn't puree the beans & broth) but it is fantastic. Ate this with a salad and roasted asparagus.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;shellybean;5;WOW! YUMMY! I don't cook often but this was totally worth it! I have been looking for a good kale recipe and this hits the spot. I added a little kraft parm. and viola! great soup!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;wisweetp;5;This gave me some excellent ideas to create a keeper for us. I kept the garlic, onion, kale, chicken stock, and white beans and used a can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes and a can of crushed tomatoes in place of the fresh tomatoes. I also added about half a cup of diced roasted red peppers and omitted the Italian herbs and used smoked Spanish paprika and let the soup simmer for about half an hour. It's thick, spicy, and delicious! And I know some of you hate when a recipe is rated when you change the ingredients so, but this one gave me such a great basis, I think it deserves 5 stars!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;chachachia;3;"I'm not sure what went wrong as I followed the recipe to the ""T"". My soup result was very bland. I added in even more salt and pepper but there was something missing, you know blah... just didn't taste right. So I threw in a pinch of cumin but that didn't help either. Perhaps it's b/c I cut out the butter? I try to cook without butter whenever possible. I love kale and beans are always good but this doesn't feel like a good match. Thanks for sharing though, I'm sure it's a really great soup!"
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;bean;5;This was fabulous, hearty, and healthy. I substituted a can of pre-seasoned diced tomatoes for texture preference.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;genevieve;4;This was a good hearty soup. I did not blend the extra beans and broth, instead I added a couple table spoons of flour to thicken the broth. I used veggie broth and all dried herbs. Great soup, I'll make it again. Thanks.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;katherine;5;This was REALLY good! I had never had kale before, and wasn't sure what to do with it when I received it in my produce co-op box. This was the perfect way to use it up. I was surprised at how sweet-tasting the soup was. I'll definitely be making this again.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jewissa;5;YUMMY! I made this soup last night using a combination of turnip, collard, and mustard greens fresh from our garden, along with a quart of canned tomatoes from this past summer. I also added about 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, as suggested by another reviewer. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly (with all that garlic!). I don't know if it would be as good with kale since that green has less pungent flavor than the greens I used--with the combo I used the soup had many LEVELS of flavor!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mommakass;5;I tried this only because I have never liked kale and couldn't believe anything with it would taste good. I was WRONG. This is so good that I have given the recipe out to all my co-workers. Don't miss this one!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;cherym;5;This was suprisingly yummy!! Who knew kale could taste so good. I didn't puree any of the beans, personal preference.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;cafeaulait;5;"To borrow from the old jingle from a soup commercial, this was ""Mmm, mmm good!"" Didn't put in the tomatoes. It was an excellent soup. Thanks."
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;cruisem;5;"We LOVED this soup!! It is extremely easy to make and tasted ""soup-er"". Thank you for the recipe. It is great for a Weight Watchers friendly meal!!!!"
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;emerri1;5;This is a great healthy dish. Love it
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;erickaki;4;Good recipe.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;namastemama;5;This is my first review here. I am inspired to write as I sit with bowl of the soup before me. This soup is awesome. It is easy, fast, and delicious. I used a can of pinto beans and a can of black eyed peas. Instead of italian seasonings, I used a seasoning blend called Pasta Seasoning by The Spice Hunter as it felt like it would go well. I also used about 2 cups additional broth and simmered for more like 30 minutes or more. I topped the soup with a bit of parmesan. Delicious!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;audreyhood;4;I LOVE this soup. I've made it twice in the past couple of weeks. Once I made it with Butter Beans, which gave a really nice smooth sort of creamy flavour. I also added a little bit of red pepper flakes to give it a little kick.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;isabelbarbosavelozo;3;I thought it would be alot better. It lacks something but not sure what, maybe more veggies or something.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;rharris524;5;It was quite good! I served it over brown rice instead of as soup. The only change was that I used canned tomatoes because that is what I had. One word of advice, chop the kale pretty small because I didn't and I regretted it.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;newtonsapple;5;Loved this recipe. Tasted great even though I used water instead of stock. I thought that 8 garlic cloves was a little too generous so I used 4.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;melnicley;5;I did not blend anything because my husband has a hard time with soup due to texture. I did 3c. of stock and a can of diced tomatoes with all the juice. I really liked it and will make again.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;steph;5;excellent soup my boyfriend loved it! I used vegan chicken like seasoning with a lot of vitamins/minerals in it and also added a dash of cajun seasoning and a dash of hot sauce which didn't add heat but added flavor but it was still good before
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;luna;4;I had kale and needed to use it in a good way. I added some fresh Hungarian peppers as well and at the end some Andouille chicken/turkey sausage. I also cooked it about half an hour longer to tenderize the kale. Very hearty fall meal with some nice bread and butter. Luna
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;singer6;4;This is really good! I used mostly veg. broth and a little chicken broth as I didn't have enough veg. Also, I used a can of diced tomatoes (drained) instead of fresh as I didn't have any on hand. I simmered it for close to an hour to get the kale soft which I prefer! Will make again and again! Healthy and tasty! Thanks for the post!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;sarahjuliana;2;this didn't turn out as good as i thought it would. Few mistakes on my part: used beef broth instead, not enough beans, too much seasoning..I think the recipe called for way to much garlic! atleast i finished my bowl..
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;misstermilkscows;5;This is the first time I've ever eaten Kale, and it fabulous! I'm a fan, and the veggies and beans made for and super easy and healthy soup. Thanks!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;annejoneshollis;5;This was easy and tasted so great! I chopped the kale in a food processor which made it easier for the kids to eat. I also doubled up on the liquid, which was a big help. This one is entering the rotation!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;rlj;5;"GREAT WITH HAM ADDED, TOO This soup is hearty, and delicious! I will return to it again and again. It's easy and quick to make but tastes like a more complex recipe. I used 1 can of cannellini beans and 1 can of white beans. I didn't have fresh tomatoes on hand, so used canned diced tomatoes (""italian""--with garlic, oregano and basil.) I used 1 cup more kale, too--and added diced ham. I simmered without lid for 15 minutes, and with lid for 20 to better blend the flavors, and also added a dash of cayenne pepper."
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;catberner;3;This soup was alright, but it just wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be, since its so healthy. Maybe it was the fresh parsley, that seemed to be all I could taste. I've also never had kale before so maybe its an aquiered taste. My husband, however, actually had seconds which surprised me.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;monagrenier;5;I made this very different because I wanted it to be more vegetably for the summertime. I used only 1 can of beans, didn't blend any, and added in 1 diced carrot and 1 diced red bell pepper, plus spicy pepper. It was really enjoyed in this house, and super healthy too, thanks!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;tmck;5;This is delicious! I normally try to make the recipe exactly as stated the first time I make something, but I was short on kale by about one cup. I topped it up with wild spinach... still fantastic!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;socialdiva;5;Absolutely delish! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out wonderful -- However, I did simmer much longer -- probably about 45 minutes total. It tasted just as great after the leftovers were frozen for a couple of weeks, the kale was even still tender. Definitely recommend this recipe for a soup lover!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;annekevdbroek;5;This soup is so good, and so easy. Often a batch only lasts one day around here, as it is eaten for lunch, snacks, and dinner. I use vegetable bullion instead of chicken stock, otherwise I follow the recipe as written.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;ferventfrugalfoodie;4;Pretty good! I used my slow cooker for this. I cooked up 1 pound of dry beans, instead of canned. Then proceeded with recipe. I used dried parsley, omitted tomatoes and did not use italian seasoning (I forgot-woops!). I set it to low and let it cook all day. Pretty good even without the italian herbs. Healthy too!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;queenbvick;5;I love this soup. I am not a good soup maker but this turned out perfectly. I am going to add sauted mushrooms tonight.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;sullivan321;5;This soup is great! I followed the recipe with the exception of two things: I didn't use the italian herbs (didn't have any) and I stuck the kale in the food processor (the smaller you can get it the better). Instead of the italian herbs I added a spoon full of red chili paste (I used Thai Kitchen's) which gave it a more interesting flavor and the slightest bit of a kick. All over a wonderfully healthy meal!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;brookeoz;5;This soup was so good. My husband does not like Kale and he LOVED this. Great for a cold winter day.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;karenwc;5;Good stuff! I made it up to the point where you mix everything together and simmer, then put it into a crockpot on low for a few hours while we were out at an event - we came home hungry and soup was on! Some parmesan cheese is good on top (I forgot the parsley), and I served it with slices of french bread topped with olive oil and parmesan and run under the broiler until toasted.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;brenda;5;Excellent soup! Smelled great cooking with the 8 cloves of garlic! I only had chick peas and didn't have any italian seasoning so used oregano. Instead of blending some beans and broth, I used my immersion blender on the whole soup. I also added some chopped spicy turkey sausage. My husband's usually not crazy about bean soups, but he says this is a keeper!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;sugarkitty;4;"This was very good; however, I did not follow the recipe exactly. I just used it as a basis for doing my own thing. I used a large can of white beans in tomato sauce, added about 3 cups water and some vegetable boullion cubes, then i put in 1 tsp. dried parsley, about 1 cup frozen ""boerenkool"" (dutch) I'm not sure if that's kale or not - I always just assumed they were one and the same but I don't know to be honest... I also used garlic powder, oregano, basil and rosemary and finally I sprinkled in some ground black pepper. It was tasty... and besides I just couldn't imagine using 10 cloves of garlic."
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kayess;4;This soup was very good, no mistake about it, but one reason I make homemade soup is that canned soup is so high in sodium. If that's a concern for you too, consider draining + rinsing the canned beans (they're packed w/sodium). If using canned tomatoes, try the no salt added kind. You can always season to taste later. I didn't make these adjustments the 1st time making this soup, but wish I did. I agree w/other reviewers: 8 cloves of garlic is too much. I say 2 or 3 is enough without being overpowering. It really was good soup! Definitely worth a try.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;stefanie;5;I thought the soup was really hearty and delicious. I added a red bell pepper and used red kidney beans instead of the white beans. Definitely recommended!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;dpcali;5;My family really liked this soup. The things I changed: reduced the garlic from 8 to 4 cloves and used one can of diced tomatoes instead of the plum tomatoes. Everybody wanted the recipe!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;robynbnb;5;I don't think I have ever had a bad soup, as I love 'em all. This was good. I didn't puree any as I didn't feel like going thru an extra step(maybe next time). I added carrot and zucchini(had to use up) and a little spinach as well. For spices I just added some basil, oregano and a mixed seasoning. For the tomatoes I added a can of diced(drained).
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mrboejangles;5;Excellent soup!!! I cut back on the garlic (it was still plentiful) to 4 cloves. Only change made. Will make this again (and again... and again).
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;canadiangirl;5;This is delicious! I made some alterations & made it in my 4 qt slowcooker/crock pot: sauteed garlic and onions, then added all the ingredients to the slowcooker for 8 hrs on low. Other changes: added 5-6 plum tomatoes, used 2 c. dried beans that were soaked overnight, and added 1 c. chopped carrots. Used fresh oregano & dried basil instead of the Italian seasoning, and added extra kale. It was healthy and yummy- perfect with crusty bread, croutons, or a sprinkling of parmigiano reggiano.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;trooworld;5;This was delicious and healthy. We made this exactly as written with the exception that we used a 15 oz can of whole tomatoes (drained and chopped) instead of the fresh tomatoes. Great way to get your greens in.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jaciss;4;"I came across this recipe when I had a fair amount of homemade black bean dip I was looking to...repurpose. I used it in this recipe instead of the white beans, and it was near-divine. The best recipe I've made from this site. I later made the recipe as stated, and found it really good, but not ""the best!"". I will be trying this again and again, I'm certain."
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;michelle;5;Sooooooo tasty! I'd never had kale before... and now I officially love it. Thanks for the delicious recipe!!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;dmwells;5;Very good soup. We added turkey kielbasa (as several raters suggested), a pinch of red pepper flakes and a little Louisiana hot sauce for an added kick.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;cookinnutt;2;It had way too much Italian spice and I didn't even put as much as it listed. It was also a pain to use the blender etc., It just wasn't good.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kristipa23;4;Great flavor. My boyfriend wasn't sure if he would like it because of all of the healthy ingredients, but we both enjoyed it very much.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;3littlebeans;4;I was pleasantly surprised by this too! I used canned tomatoes and bigger cans of beans than it called for. I expected the kale to wilt more like spinach, but it held it's shape, so be sure to chop it as small as you want it to be when you eat it (I left mine too big). Otherwise it had great flavor.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;foodie77;5;Very hearty soup. Would definitely make this recipe again and again.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;stickmodee;5;"This recipe is fantastic. I use 2 types of beans for variation and some color. I also added a 6 oz. package of spinach .( Make sure you drain the spinach well or it can overpower the flavor of the soup)It is loaded with vitamins. My wife calls it ""Resturant Quality"". Will make again and again."
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;kikid;4;"This was my first experience with kale, and it was great. I added to the recipe chopped carrots and celery with onions and garlic; left out 1 c. of broth; extra spices; and threw in some turkey kielbasa. It was delicious. I think it may have been a little boring for me without the extras though."
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;chrisdwilliams;5;This was very good as written, although I did not blenderize the second can of beans as described. The recipe is even better when you add 1/2 pound of sliced keilbasa sausage (low fat is fine), sauteed and tossed on top of the soup before serving. Another good addition is a cup of heavy cream stirred in just before serving.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;docswife;5;Different but very good!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;tinaki;5;I tried this recipe because I was looking for different uses of kale. This hearty soup did not disappoint. I made the recipe exactly, and it was very tasty. For my personal preference, I simmered the soup a lot longer (about 15 minutes with the lid off to concentrate the flavor, and then about 20 minutes with the lid on) because even with the tough ribs removed, the kale took a while to become tender. Additionally, I always cook any soups and pasta sauces ahead of time so the flavors can develop overnight. It truly makes a big difference, and it's a nice to treat to have lunch or dinner made in advance! Thanks for the great recipe.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;simply;5;I have made this soup a few times now. And I LOVE IT! For some of you that need your meat. The last time I made the soup I added some cooked ground turkey to the bottom of the bowl.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;magoo00;5;Oh yeah...loved this! I was a little doubtful while it was going together, but it magically came together in the end. A couple more great recipes like this one and I'll become a vegetarian for sure!!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;labougie;5;Extremely tasty and wonderfully easy to prepare!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;mvaeth;5;this was a good soup with interesting flavor-very unique. Next time, I would add something else-maybe some carrots and celery
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;killerbroccoli;5;This is really great. The first time I made it I used collard greens instead of kale because they looked so good at the farmer's market and my boyfriend gobbled it up, despite the fact he normally won't eat things with beans or tomatoes in them. The second time I added a pinch of cayenne pepper and a blend of collards, turnip greens, spinach and musard greens. YUM! It also freezes really well.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;elifcelebiwisecup;5;AWESOME.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;erind;4;Very good, even better the next day after the flavors had more time to marinate. I initially did not add salt after reading comments about the saltiness of kale, but ended up sprinkling a dash on every bowl. Thanks for a great, easy recipe!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;hsyousef;5;This soup was YUMMY!!!! My super picky husband actually fought me for the leftovers. I only changed it a small bit. I put two cans of beans and added a few cut up carrots. Also, I substituted Herbs de Provence (with an extra pinch of rosemary) for italian season... its sounds subtle but makes a world of difference. Also I didn't put quite as much garlic. Really good with cornbread.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;xxxnaughty;4;Everyone in my family SURPRISINGLY loved this! I liked it... it was pretty good. Didn't look too appetizing but great flavour!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;estephan;5;Wow, I don't know where the flavor came from, but for such a simple recipe with low-impact ingredients, it all came together perfectly. I will make again and again for a delicious and healthy lunch!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;marim;5;This is yummy. Kidney beans definitely work if you need a replacement. I use a can of diced tomatoes when tomatoes aren't their freshest. A little parmesan cheese sprinkled over the top makes for good presentation. I freeze excess and it tastes just as good when reheated.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jillcb14;5;SO good. I can't cook at all but now everyone thinks I can, after this soup! I didn't have a blender so I added hummus instead of the bean/broth mixture, and it was great. I also tried using 2 types of kale and it was even better.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;bitchnkitchen;5;LOVE IT!!! This is so healthy, low fat and delicious. I recently bought a high quality pressure cooker and don't know how I survived without it. I cooked the onions and garlic first and then added the spices and veggies. I used imagine vegetable broth which is an excellent broth. Then I cooked it in the pressure cooker for 10 min and so the kale is really soft and all the flavors infused through the soup. I have never blended beans for soup before and gave that a try and really felt it added something to the soup. I think it makes it more substantial. I also added a tbsp of fresh lemon juice at the end. My vegetarian daughter is thrilled with this and so am I.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;jtif;5;wonderful recipe. I used Kidney beans, due to the shortage of other kinds. Great chicken soup. I used the slow cooker to cook whole thing. The kale did not look as freshly green as it should , but it taste much better. I asked my friend to taste. At the first place, she was suspecticle at it. After taste it, she asked me to give her one quote to bring home for her family.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;astrid;5;This soup is very healthy and tastes so great.My husband just loved it.The flavors mingle really well.Mixing part of the beans in a blender gives the soup the nice creamy look and taste.It is a keeper for my family.Chopping the veggies takes a bit of time.So I would recommend using a machine.Double the recipe and freeze the extra.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;zannah17;5;"So good!!! Very healthy soup & suprisingly flavorful! I wanted to try kale, but was a bit hesitant to make this soup because it didn't look like it had enough ""spice"". I was SO wrong. This is a soup I can make again & again. Thank you!!!"
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;fba;4;I washed the kale several times & removed the leaves from the center stalk. As I omitted the dried Italian herb seasoning (due to family preference), I added some crushed red pepper flakes for flavor. If the soup's too thick, just add more broth. I sprinkled parmesan on top at the table too. You probably could substitute escarole for the kale as well if you wanted to vary the recipe.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;nikita;5;delightful! I added a tiny bit of salt to it, but wouldn't characterize it as bland at all.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;noraspat;5;I have used this recipe since I saw it in an article on eye health. It is one of our favorites. I sometimes substitute one can of Dark kidney beans for one of Cannellini and I blend the kidney beans for thickening. It varies it a little and is just as great. We love it either way.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;serrabee;4;This is a great, tasty soup---and very healthy, too!
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;252becky;5;This soup is really great! Make sure you get the reduced sodium chicken broth (kale is very salty). I added some tofu for an extra protein punch.
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;helcho;5;"Easy, delicious and healthy. I ended up using left over kale from the ""kale stir fry"" recipe (which I didn't like) and it turned out fine. This soup is hearty and surpisingly good. Would be even better (but not as healthy) if you add some kielbasa."
e6840f02-6857-47b2-b967-7f3652079be5;lulu57;5;My husband suffers from macular degeneration and was told to eat as much kale as he possibly can. I've tried many different recipes but he enjoyed this more than any of the rest.
6a9f472b-d779-4dea-bac2-2a7639063d19;objen;5;This is delicious! I added raspberries to make it even more fruity.
6a9f472b-d779-4dea-bac2-2a7639063d19;addison;5;I made this with frozen pineapple and mangos and it was amazing!! I did more mango than pineapple, which was best.
6a9f472b-d779-4dea-bac2-2a7639063d19;internationalcooking;5;So tasty! My blender was, unfortunately, broken, so I had to improvise, a phrase which here means “smash the strawberries with a potato masher.”I did add the salt and lemon juice, just to balance the sugar. Also-I made it with a bunch of fresh mint from my garden. So refreshing! It was surprisingly flavorful and crumbly. However, it melts very fast on a hot day...eat quickly!!
6a9f472b-d779-4dea-bac2-2a7639063d19;bernadette;5;This was amazing, followed as written and everyone loved it.
6a9f472b-d779-4dea-bac2-2a7639063d19;yoly;5;Very good and simple to make. I thought it was delicious!
6a9f472b-d779-4dea-bac2-2a7639063d19;nkamm;5;Made it exactly as written. I had made a rather heavy meal for company and wanted something light for dessert -- this was the perfect choice. My husband loved it and he didn't expect to. I'll be make more of this with other fruit as well -- Yummy!
6a9f472b-d779-4dea-bac2-2a7639063d19;gray;5;A Yum, Yummy lunch, paired with a feather than airy Twill, a huge success! In a martini glass with a spiral twill?? A recipe that don't need adjustments is a fave in my kitchen. But, I was so awe that forgot to take a photo??
6a9f472b-d779-4dea-bac2-2a7639063d19;stephenlacombe;5;Added blueberries myself and switched sugar for less amount of pics granulated sweetener for my diabetic husband. It’s amazing!
6a9f472b-d779-4dea-bac2-2a7639063d19;linda;4;This was very simple to make and tasted amazing.
6a9f472b-d779-4dea-bac2-2a7639063d19;cara;5;This was a WOW and a new favorite in my house.
6a9f472b-d779-4dea-bac2-2a7639063d19;katiewong;4;I like to put some basil on top but the rest was a hit on my kids
6a9f472b-d779-4dea-bac2-2a7639063d19;terri;5;Love this. Made no changes to the recipe and was very pleased with the results.
6a9f472b-d779-4dea-bac2-2a7639063d19;cooldeb;5;Very refreshing and yummy! This is a great way to use an abundance of strawberries from our garden patch. Very simple recipe but make sure you leave enough time for the freezing and stirring. I make mine in the morning and it is ready to devour in the summer evenings . Make sure you don't omit the balsamic vinegar. It adds brightness to the dish.
6a9f472b-d779-4dea-bac2-2a7639063d19;donnawelker;5;no, no changes. wonderful as it was in the recipe.
6a9f472b-d779-4dea-bac2-2a7639063d19;bakingqueen;5;It was a delicious and refreshing treat that is just perfect for a sweet tooth craving. It helps satisfy that sweet tooth without all the sugar! Absolutely Marvelous! I hope everyone has a fun time making it as well! :)
6a9f472b-d779-4dea-bac2-2a7639063d19;cmach;5;I made this last summer( a little late in my review) and my kids came to spend the night with my grand children. The weather was so hot and this was so refreshing! They told me not to bother buying popsicles any more!
6a9f472b-d779-4dea-bac2-2a7639063d19;abbyz2000;4;It was a little sweet but it tasted good. I told my daughter it was like a snow cone so it seemed like a fun summer treat to her.
6a9f472b-d779-4dea-bac2-2a7639063d19;beverlycorbitt;5;I took this as a technique rather than a strict recipe. I didn't have 2# of strawberries but had a seedless watermelon and fresh mint and limes on my deck so that was what I used. I did put in some salt and some white balsamic. It was excellent! Will try with various other fruits.
6a9f472b-d779-4dea-bac2-2a7639063d19;chargreene;5;I made this with frozen strawberries in my Nutramax blender and it came out creamy and delicious. Perfect for my lactose intolerant son and relatively healthy for the rest of us.
6a9f472b-d779-4dea-bac2-2a7639063d19;cristyinsc;5;Awesome! Turned out just like he said. Only difference is it took much longer to freeze bc I have a small overcrowded freezer bc my other freezer died. So look it took over night to really freeze. We tried the every 45 minutes thing. After the 4th 45 minute we just decided to wait. We used all the ingredients. Tastes awesome.
6a9f472b-d779-4dea-bac2-2a7639063d19;else;5;Wow, Chef John, you did it again. Everyone loved it. But it only made 4 servings! Ha. Please keep up the videos.
6a9f472b-d779-4dea-bac2-2a7639063d19;shirleymatthys;4;Very, very. Good. Refreshing!
6a9f472b-d779-4dea-bac2-2a7639063d19;animalluver;5;Had this last nite with Lasagna. Very filling yet light. I thought this would taste like ice but it didn't! The strawberry's are creamy but not heavy. I would defiantly eat this as a summer refresher. : )
6a9f472b-d779-4dea-bac2-2a7639063d19;walid;5;Its great and keep me fresh in the summer
6a9f472b-d779-4dea-bac2-2a7639063d19;seatiger;4;Really good! Extremely easy, but very refreshing to have on a hot summer day!
592043a7-fd2e-4762-a511-ca41f501dfd1;leonatrask;5;Awesome
592043a7-fd2e-4762-a511-ca41f501dfd1;audreyarthur;5;Delicious recipe! It was easy to make and my husband and I just love the texture and taste.
592043a7-fd2e-4762-a511-ca41f501dfd1;briannamcindoeroy;5;I substituted carrot for celery root, it turned out great! Broccoli soup is one of my faves and now being dairy free it’s nice to have something tasty without needing cream! ??
592043a7-fd2e-4762-a511-ca41f501dfd1;jenlosorio;5;I substituted carrot instead of celery root since I could not find celery root. It is delicious and creamy!
592043a7-fd2e-4762-a511-ca41f501dfd1;krisnorman;5;I didn't follow the veggie amounts very closely, and used a stock pot rather than a sauce pan, so I ended up using most of another carton of broth to cover the veggies. I used 3 golden potatoes and 2 large crowns of broccoli. It blended up very easily with my immersion blender, and I enjoy the texture. I topped this with crispy cheese and croutons, and it was delicious.
592043a7-fd2e-4762-a511-ca41f501dfd1;angelika;5;absolutely delicious. I subbed parsnips for the celery root because it's what I had on hand.. I put about half the soup in the blender and stirred in the other half to give some chunks and texture. So worth the effort, but easy- would make this again and again! great way to use several winter root vegetables. thank you!
592043a7-fd2e-4762-a511-ca41f501dfd1;lama;5;Great creamy taste ! My kids loved it !
592043a7-fd2e-4762-a511-ca41f501dfd1;lindat;5;Very tasty base soup. I seasoned it differently every night
ce3cf7c9-ae3e-45c6-8d65-d40679b985ab;francec;5;Not much to it, but a great way to prep those summer homegrown tomatoes to use up later. Like diced canned tomatoes, but 1000x better. I added a sprinkle of salt to really make those fresh flavors shine. You can do so many things with these. The skins just slipped off, great technique!

b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;sammydavis;5;Absolutely delightful. I did 30 minutes of cook time, tossing them at the 15 minute mark. Perfect.
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;grandmacan;5;Awesome. Easy to make and taste great as per recipe.
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;darlenebarth;5;Added some extra spice seasoned pepper besides the garlic. Versatile and easy!
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;pamfunk;5;I followed the recipe and my potatoes turned out great. We're making them again tonight.
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;nhgrammy;5;We liked these.
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;merit;3;The picture shows baby potatoes cut in half, not quarters as the recipe stated. I made them cut in half.
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;kathyestes;5;Delicious..
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;marterkuile;5;It was awesome in the air fryer for exactly 30 minutes. I changed it a bit by using lots of fresh garlic and fresh parsley. It's almost addictively delicious and super easy.
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;kar;4;I loved the simplicity of making these potatoes in the air fryer. They came out
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;doklink;4;Had to cook 25 minutes. Easy to make. Good flavor. Crispy on the outside, tender inside.
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;lindykelley;5;Yum yum yummy, we loved them
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;raquell;5;Delicious and super easy. The only change I made was using olive oil. I didn’t even use any salt and the potatoes were still very flavorful.
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;miranda;5;Delicious and easy to make. Just added some paprika to give it a twist. Yum!
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;jim;5;Very good will definitely make them again
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;michaelbuckley;4;Very easy, needed to cook it a bit longer. Great flavors
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;marilynchappell;5;These were very good the whole family enjoyed them. It was a quick and easy side dish that was delicious
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;debbie;5;Crisp and tasty!
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;haileyrocafuerte;5;These were delicious. I used small golden potatoes cut in 4ths. My air fryer cooked them in about 16 minutes. It took no time to prepare. This is my new go-to for a breakfast and dinner side.
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;unchinngo;5;Simple recipe that came out just right- tasty, moist and slightly crunchy on the outside (but you must take out the potatoes right away without letting them sit inside the air fryer). I have a 6-quart air fryer so I made 1.5lbs of mini Yukon potatoes at 350 degrees for 20 minutes and I didn’t even have to turn them. This is the easiest and best roast potatoes I’ve ever made!
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;cushlagirl;4;Would definitely make it again. Nice n crispy!
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;patty;5;Made this recipe. Turned out great. Will definitely make again!
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;suziematoozie;4;Very good. BUT....I only had to roast them in my air fryer for 8 minutes! I would just say they all vary, be sure to take the basket out and shake them up and put them back in at 4-5 minute increments. I’m glad I did, otherwise they would have come out hard as a rock! But I do love the flavor and crispness these had! Thanks for sharing!
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;susanwarshell;5;Easy and delicious. I used the multicolored small potatoes and cut them in half, not quarter. Will make often - having them tonight in fact!
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;sara;4;They tasted very good, but a little dry. I think I could have cooked them for a few minutes less. Overall, my first time using my air fryer and I love it.
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;freda;5;Love it. My family loved it. They came out browned and crispy. The only change that I made was, I used olive oil instead of avocado oil. Tasted great. Will you make often.
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;pj4uk;5;This was delicious! We will be making this again, I promise you!
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;pj4uk;5;This was delicious! We will be making this again, I promise you!
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;travesty;4;Great potatoes! Pretty perfect. Suggestions: add a little more oil for a little more crunch, thyme and or chopped green onion.
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;klm;5;Only made one change, I used olive oil. They looked and tasted great, thank you Bren for a delicious recipe.
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;sarahcoop;3;"Maybe I didn't use the right potatoes - the insides weren't fluffy and the outside was a little chewy. What type of ""baby potatoes"" are best to use? I used little multi colored ones."
b2bc0cab-51fc-41b2-b560-a4ffca941920;souplovingnicole;5;These are excellent and perfect as written. This comes as no surprise to me though. This makes the 7th recipe I've made from this recipe submitter and they have all been 5 stars. I haven't always loved my air fryer but thanks to Bren and her recipes, I do now. These potatoes cooked perfectly and were super simple to make. I highly recommend you try these.
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;cassiejohnson;5;The best applesauce ever! Easy to make, definitely use the food mill. I’m filling up my freezer with this recipe!
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;elaine;5;Used 2 Honey Crisp apples, the balance being MacIntosh. The result was awesome! Made another batch to freeze. Will try with other apples. Thank you!
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;lihinglilikoi;5;Forget your old idea of what you think applesauce tastes like. Make this and your mind will be blown. Seriously. I added white sugar to taste after cooking. Whirled ? of it in the blender to smooth it out and because I did not peel organic Costco apples. Four minutes, natural release 10 minutes in the IP, but half the water. Eat it warm. Top with a broken crunchy granola bar. Absolutely delicious.
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;jeffglosenger;5;Made it and came out GREAT! Pretty much followed the recipe used Cortland apples. Came out pink because of the apples. Again looks and taste wonderful. Will be using this recipe from now on.
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;suebeedo;5;This is the best applesauce I’ve ever had. I used Cortland apples and I doubled the recipe. I’ll probably make more because this will disappear fast. The lemon made it awesome! Thank you so much for sharing this outstanding recipe.
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;lovealltennis;5;Delicious. I will definitely make again. I only used the brown sugar. Not sure if I really needed it as the apples I used were mostly the sweeter types. As another reviewer suggested, I too put the lemon peel in a tea ball to make it easier to retrieve the lemon peel in the end. I use a dough masher to break up the apples once they are cooked. It offers a nice, slightly chunky texture.
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;kkrob;5;Best applesauce I’ve ever had and so easy to make!! My husband absolutely loves it too! I used a crockpot instead and used a blender to smooth it out. Can’t wait to make more!!
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;pattiteetsnoon;5;I made this in my instapot, cooked on vegetable setting for 8 minutes and used immersion blender to mash. My husband's new favorite applesauce!
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;jenny;5;Terrific flavor - will definitely make it again.
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;markat;5;This recipe turned out super. It was delicious to eat and quick to make. Only problemn was it was so good it never made it to the freezer. Will be making again.
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;terrij;5;awesome sauce
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;jaybraun;5;Very easy to make. I didn't make any changes, but next time I might try to make it with lo-cal brown sugar and/or non-sugar sweetener. Apples have plenty of carbs by themselves, so added sugar doesn't help.
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;marilyn;4;I don't peel apples as therein lies lots of nutrition. I use an applesauce mill (arm exercise!), no peeling or coring , which draws most of the nutritional content from the peels (minus some fiber) and when in a hurry I use a blender but then I do have to core them. Make with monk fruit in place of sugar and add more cinnamon, because there is never too much for my taste.
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;samart;4;The apples were from my tree but they were very small (1”-3” diameter) I tried peeling a couple but it wasn’t easy. Next time, with similar sized apples I’ll blanch them (boiling water for 30-60 seconds, then immerse in ice water for a minute or two.... easy peasy peel.
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;d;5;This was my first time making apple sauce, since I had a lot of apples on hand. In fact I have never been a big fan of applesauce in general. HOWEVER I am a HUGE fan now. This recipe was absolutely delicious, the fabulous spark to the recipe was the addition of lemons (which I am addicted too). Thank you so much for this recipe. AH-mazing!
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;ruthhyde;5;I added some fresh ground nutmeg and 1/2 tsp cardamom. Ut was amazing.
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;deb;5;"Great recipe, and very easy! I used to help my mom freeze applesauce years ago peeling endlessly, cutting apples, and then using a pressure cooker. This was far easier; I threw everything in my crockpot and 3 hours later, done. It is an amazing, and very tasty recipe!"
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;pearlie5;5;Excellent. Very fresh apple taste and the right sweetness- my apples weren't overly sweet. I had to pick my apples off my trees after hail damage and had been cutting them up and eating them, and today it was time to use the rest of them. I had Golden Delicious and Tydeman's Late Orange apples. Made this as written except I left the peels on and put the peels that remained in the foley food mill into my blender to chop up more. Sooooo good, I liked the addition of some lemon. I added more ground cinnamon after cooking, my sticks are old. I was going to freeze some but I think I will wind up eating it all!
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;karen;5;love this recipe. a keeper for sure! followed as directed used less white sugar.
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;jilldragon;5;I've never made applesauce from scratch before, so I honestly don't have anything else to compare it to apart from the store bought stuff - but this recipe is miles and away better. I made it with a mix of golden (very)delicious and red (not)delicious apples - about 2/3 golden and 1/3 red. The only change I made from the recipe was to reduce the white sugar to about 2 tablespoons. And honestly, next time if I use a similar mix of apples I'll omit it altogether.
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;lisa;5;I addd some strawberries I had in the freezer that I needed to use up and this recipe still turned out fantastic. If you do that and the berries are still partially frozen, just strain out some of the juice after you cook it all. I knew I needed all the water from the recipe when cooking so followed that to a T. Will make this one again.
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;brasil8a;5;The lemon juice and zest are key here! Best applesauce for me, ever.
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;kimg;5;Awesome recipe. I skipped the white sugar, which is really not needed, and used my favourite baking apples - Northern Spies. I found I couldn't get the lemon zest back out, but it was OK - just adds a bit of tang when you bite into it. Knowing that, I might cut it up a bit smaller next time, and just not worry about trying to get it out. Since my family likes our applesauce spicy, I used 3 cinnamon sticks, added 6 whole cloves, and grated in some nutmeg. The cloves and cinnamon sticks definitely need to come back out, of course!
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;hcserpnyak;5;Delicious and easy to make.
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;carolmarkham;5;Will now only make this applesauce!
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;kathryn;5;I didn't add any sugar. It turned out fine.
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;kimberlyrekrut;4;I used only the brown sugar and it was great
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;april;5;Very good....followed the recipe as written. Wondered if there would be too much lemon, but it's perfect and adds a lot. Might add a little more cinnamon to it, just as my personal taste. Great without it too. I used the slow cooker and halved the recipe because I only had 4 apples.
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;libertybelle78;5;Very Crock Pot friendly recipe. This was my first attempt at applesauce. I cored, but did not peel the apples, and I added a pint of blueberries. Cooked it overnight and after cooling it the next day, I removed the fruit and mashed it with the hand blender. There was quite a bit of juice left, so perhaps a bit less water is needed for the Crock Pot version. Still, it was perfect, and so easy. Plus, blending the skins in to the sauce gives it a pretty color!
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;spoonnlime;5;This recipe reminds people how much they love apple sauce. I left out the lemon zest (no lemon on hand) and because I had used sweet apples I almost halved the sugar according to my taste. I left it a bit chunky too! Saving this one to make for years to come.
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;peggycanfieldpeck;5;This was the best applesauce I ever made. I thought 1 cup of water was too much so I only used a half cup. It was plenty. I will make it again with maybe a little less lemon. Delicious. :-)
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;culady;5;Loved how this turned out. I put the ingredients in a crock pot for three hours on high. Ran my immersion blender through to make it smooth and it's ready for the freezer. I only used the brown sugar didn't add the white sugar. I believe the fresh lemon juice and zest is key.
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;shaykessler;5;I used Fugi apples and doubled the recipe and the results were great. It does taste delicious warm over vanilla ice cream! We froze it and enjoyed it for weeks! Thanks for the great recipe
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;elliemitchell;5;This is, by far, the BEST applesauce I have ever made. Our neighbors gave us two different boxes of their apples (don't even know what kind...a lot like Gala or Fuji). I had 7 cups apples for the first batch and 8 cups for the second. Note: I put the lemon peel in a tea ball so I could remove it more easily. My family raved about it!!!
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;tami;5;This is an awesome recipe! I added nutmeg and used green apples from my tree in the backyard! This will be a wonderful addition to my kids schools lunches!
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;funmonkey;5;So yum!!! I did happen to add nutmeg, because I love spices, but tasted before, and it was really good. Will do again!
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;ashleye;5;"Made this as gifts for Christmas 2013 and four months later my family is still asking for more! My 1 1/2 year old nephew kept saying ""Mmmmmmm more apple!"" and kept licking the spoon. There's no better review in my book than that :) The lemon peels are the key to success for this recipe!"
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;annep;5;Simple and sweet! I use ground cinnamon and no lemon juice/zest since I am usually just trying to use up apples and don't have these on hand. I blend it in my blender, quick and easy! Yummy!
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;daynayockey;5;I made a large quantity of this recipe with 20 pounds of MacIntosh apples. I left out the lemon zest (my preference only) and decreased the sugar just a bit. It is deliciously sweet with a little lemony zip from the juice and the tartness of the apples still comes through. Rather than freezing, I chose to can mine in small jars with two servings each. It is a beautiful consistency and texture. Thank you, I have found my applesauce recipe!
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;j9;5;Love this applesauce! I put everything in a slow cooker on high and in 3 hours it was done. I have little ones so I used the hand blender to smooth out what little bumps were left. DELICIOUS!
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;smokey;5;"I just finished making it and the house smells wonderful. Of course I had to lick the spatula after the last stir and.... yummmm. I cut the recipe to make about 1 quart, enough for two meals. Our Mac tree is very ""giving"" this year and I know there will be a lot of applesauce in the freezer. Thanks for the recipe robcrow and thank you for the crockpot idea Sarah Jo!"
79175c9c-e3af-4466-bebf-36a2ecfd7513;sarahjo;5;This also works out well in the crockpot. Just throw everything in the crockpot leave it for most of the day and by the time you go to fish out the cinnamon sticks/lemon peel, it pretty much is ready to go. All you have to do is run a hand blender or potato masher slightly. DOUBLES WELL.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;bringtheheat;4;I love how easy this is. I added grated parmesan after the Cajon seasoning and it was great.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;laurelj;5;This was simple and delicious. I put 1/2 tsp olive oil in my hands and rubbed the asparagus before adding lemon pepper seasoning.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;jenniferhanson;5;Couldn't be easier! Very tasty!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;kjo;3;just okay.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;melissa;5;Quick, easy, and tasted great.... will do this again.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;mwhite;5;Excellent! I added some butter and a little garlic, but it was fantastic, and a hit at Thanksgiving!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;mde;5;Asparagus is not my favorite vegetable but my husband loves it and does the grocery shopping so I end up making it more than I would like. I really enjoyed this recipe for the taste and ease of preparation. Instead of Cajun seasoning, I used garlic salt and lemon pepper. My husband loved it, too. This is definitely the way I will be preparing asparagus from now on.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;dorothybudzdrumheller;5;Love this recipe. This is one that I don't even need a book for. Made it again tonight, so easy.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;vickij;5;It was quick and simple to make. That is what I was looking for. It tastes delicious ... not disappointed at all!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;abbynormal;5;Shock and awe - this was incredibly fast and easy clean too - last minute desperation move - found the recipe and was able to add it to the quivering Thai pork tenderloin which was almost finished cooking in time for both to come out together (almost)
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;butterbo99;5;It was very good. I used Tony Thatcher's Creole seasoning.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;jacjac;4;Terrific. What a low calorie, time saving and delicious recipe for a busy family that loves it. Thanks.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;thedoggisabelle;5;Tasted great! Soft, but enough substance to make the stalks fresh tasting. Used salt, pepper, Season All salt, a bit of olive oil. Easy and delicious. Pretty!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;candacehallberg;4;This was really good and easy! I didn’t have the miso paste, and I left out the the pepper flakes because my 8 yo would not eat them. They turned out tasty, tho, and even the picky 8 yo ate some.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;ketotaco;5;These are great! Sprinkle some “slap ya mama” seasoning on them and bingo! Delicious!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;pchidester;5;It was so very good! I made a whole cookie sheet full of asparagus and it got rave reviews for our Easter dinner! Easy and tender, I only sprinkled some garlic in addition to the other ingredients. We will be having this over and over again.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;margaret;5;This is my go to asparagus recipe. The whole family likes it and so easy!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;se;5;Another good way of fixing asparagus. I used Creole Seasoning Blend recipe from this site.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;yvette;5;This is a good and easy recipe. Highly recommend for beginners.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;kimwhite;4;Everyone ate them up. Very fast and good. We loved it!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;sandy;5;This was awesome, thank you!!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;lisainphoenix;4;We eat asparagus several times a week so it’s great to have various recipes in the rotation. This one is super easy and tasty. It’s nice if you want a side with a little zing.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;sallyaustin;5;Really good and really fast!!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;christinamarkin;5;I used salt, pepper, parmesan cheese and butter... very tasty!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;madeleineneveskym;5;Only way I will cook asparagus!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;hannahhall;4;I didn't have any Cajun seasoning, so I just drizzled some olive oil and sprinkled some salt on the asparagus before they went in the oven. My boyfriend (who's the chef in our relationship) said the asparagus were cooked longer than they needed to be but they still turned out tasty!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;marlonjocelynliedy;5;Absolutely great! I used a little crushed red pepper, because I love spice.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;michellewatsonchrist;5;Quick and easy. Very flavorful and my family loved it.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;lisafinn;5;My husband loves it!! And so easy to make.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;poetdoll;5;This is my go-to recipe! So easy for a gourmet dish! I omit the cajun seasoning and use a bit of salt and olive oil. Once it is out of the oven I put sliced almonds and shaved parmesan cheese on top! So impressive with so little work!!!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;esmeralda;5;I thought this was quite yummy! I didn't have any Cajun seasoning so I used some Old Bay and it was delightful. I put the asparagus in a Tupperware container, drizzled some olive oil on top, added the seasoning, and then shook it all up. We have now added a new vegetable to our rotation.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;shirleyclaire;3;The seasoning I used made it too salty. My bad.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;jazleenuh;4;Very easy recipe indeed. Though, it came out still chewy for my first try. I used a toaster oven so I might need to tweak the time a bit more next time. thanks for sharing!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;adi2d30;3;More spice made it better tasting
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;rina;4;Loved the flavor and was so easy make. I added Italian seasoning.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;mccombss;5;This could not be any easier. I used Old Bay!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;cooking42;5;Super easy and delicious! You can adjust seasonings to your liking.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;liz;5;This was absolutely the best Ive tried so far!! Thanks for sharing
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;joyce711;4;So impressed how quick and easy it was to make fresh asparagus that looks like I made it on the grill.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;justjam;3;this was pretty good.. but it was superfast as the title states.. i used Creole Seasoning Blend from this site and wish i would have gone a little heavier with the shaker.. my asparagus were on the larger side and were still pretty firm when i took them out at ten minutes.. which was fine as i hate mushy veggies.. ty for the recipe
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;apmilne;4;As far as basic asparagus, this is a very easy and delicious recipe. I think next time I might add garlic or lemon or something just to make it a little more flavorful.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;catrinawilliams;5;Super quick and tasty. Can't believe I didn't think to do this sooner!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;keyna;5;I love this recipe! Very versatile. I have followed the recipe to a T and tried several other seasoning...same great outcome...PERFECT. Thanks for sharing!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;tawnyaluna;5;This is delicious. Make sure to cut off the bottom ends of the asparagus.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;andrewntandriapruett;5;New to this healthy cooking stuff...cooking at all for that matter. Bought asparagus, determined to cook it..and find a way the family likes it. I didn't have Cajun seasoning so I found a recipe for that in Allrecipes as well. Made it, everyone liked it...so we will have it again!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;curtmcley;5;So simple and easy. Two ingredients? But don't let the small number of ingredients lead you astray. I was concerned that the Cajun seasoning may be too strong, so I didn't use much on my initial try. Next time, I'll use more seasoning. An excellent side dish, but my son had only the asparagus for supper. He said it was awesome.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;hstaple1979;5;Excellent recipe overall, great taste!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;cher;5;So good! 15 mins might be 2-3 minutes too long in the oven for me but still was delicious as our side dish tonight. Thanks for sharing this recipe.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;davidjackson;5;I used canola oil and some cajun seasonings. Smells and tastes wonderful!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;patri;5;This was easy and tasty. Will do again for sure
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;ywayland;5;So simple and delicious. Nice nutty flavor
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;sarahmelodee;5;I'm 5 star rating my own because this recipe I made was by far the best asparagus I've ever had. Better than Restaraunts! In zip lock bag add a bundle of asparagus and poor olive oil, sprinkle kosher salf(make sure it's kosher salt because it brings out the best flavor), sprinkle black pepper and poor about a tablespoon and a half of aged balsamic vinegar in the bag, close the bag and shake it all around. Let marinate for about 2 hours. Cook for 9 minutes at 475 degrees!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;heatherc;5;Thank you for a simple, yet delicious way to make asparagus. I drizzled and brushed them with EVOO. I didn't have cajun seasoning, so I used Adobe seasoning with garlic powder and pepper.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;carol;4;4.5 for fast and easy. I had some premixed Cajun seasoning, garlic pepper, salt and black pepper from another recipe and I sprinkled that on it. Yum.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;davepinkus;5;just did salt. very tasty
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;staceywiegertfoley;4;Very tasty!! I did as the recipe suggested, but I think other types of spices can be used for different flavors.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;ywms;4;Very easy to prepare and simply delicious!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;melrich;5;Delicious and easy recipe although after a few attempts I took out the Cajun seasoning and just used salt and pepper.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;natereifenheiser;5;I made this with some chicken cordon bleu. My family devoured it. And it was super easy to throw in after the chicken came out of the oven and just wait 10 minutes.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;chaffee;5;Tossed with a little olive oil and Old Bay seasoning. Unbelievably good - my kids fought over the last few pieces!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;charlee;5;This is now my new favorite way to fix asparagus.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;sugarblue;5;Easy and surprisingly good!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;kandiyohiv;5;Really good, super fast. Don't add any salt since the Cajun seasoning already has a bunch. Don't add the Cajun seasoning while the asparagus is sitting in a baking sheet in the hot oven it rises up and gets in your eyes.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;judy;4;Good. Like the spiciness. Drizzled olive oil on instead of cooking spray.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;conkyjoe;4;Quick and easy, and the Cajun seasoning gives this side dish a special twist. Placed cut asparagus on a baking pan lined w/ parchment paper for a super fast clean-up too. Used Creole Seasoning Blend from this site. After removing from oven, garnished with grated Pecorino Romano cheese.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;duboo;5;This was a big hit. I layed the asparagus out on parchment paper in a pan, sprinkled with Old Bay and baked for 10 minutes. I removed and sprinkled with an Italian cheese mixture and baked for an addition 3 minutes. Excellent. It don't get any simpler than this.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;ang1980;5;I just tried this and it is great. As suggested by others I coated the asparagus in olive oil then seasoned with cajun seasoning.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;mrsc;3;Pretty good, and yes, super fast.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;mlee80817;4;This was pretty good...go light on the oil. I used a shake of garlic and onion powder in addition to the Cajun seasoning plus some parmesan cheese. We will make this again.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;hannaelizabeth;4;Thank you for sharing this recipe. It's a great jumping off point. I use a variation of this recipe at least once a week (as long as I can get fresh Asparagus). Here's what I do different: I don't use cooking spray, I use olive oil. I also don't use Cajun spices. I use garlic and just the tiniest bit of sea salt. It turns out delicious every time. Just a side note, sometimes Asparagus comes in thinner stalks, when that happens, I cut the cooking time down to half. For the thicker stalks, 15 minutes seems to be just about right.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;sarahruthlady;5;Great, simple, and quick! What more could you ask?
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;jrchef;4;Add garlic powder
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;baylameltzer;4;Fast, easy and delicious! Need I say more?
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;indianagal;5;Great & Superfast: I lined baking sheet with foil. Then tossed cut up asparagus with extra virgin olive oil, seasoned salt and garlic powder. I cannot eat black pepper or spicy seasonings. Placed on foil and roasted. Checked at 8 minutes and was tender and crunchy. Cancer patient without a lot of energy so this recipe is fantastic.. Trying to eat more green vegetables and this will now be a weekly favorite. Kept going back for more !!!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;melinda;4;Excellent recipe! I use light olive oil rather than the spray oil. As well, I sometimes prepare the same way only using garlic powder, salt, & sprinkle with shredded parmesan cheese the last 5 min. Delicious!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;andrea333;5;I drizzle the stalks with olive oil instead of cooking spray and am quite liberal with the cajun seasoning. My husband, who dislikes vegetables, asks for this recipe!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;califun123;5;Delicious!!! I loved the seasoning....a great taste! I did add a little olive oil to the asparagus before cooking as well. A great change up to steaming and grilling...thanks!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;irenebrennan;5;This is delish just as it is and a keeper - thank you !
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;johsplenda;5;This is almost too easy! I was a little afraid of the cajun seasoning since I was serving it to guests so I went with a little seasoned salt and a little cajun seasoning. It was great. Even my non-cooking friend asked for the recipe because she thought even she could handle it. Using the foil in the pan and the spray olive oil makes it even easier but it looks like something special.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;koffegirl;5;I used olive oil and lemon pepper and it turned out great. I think you can use any seasoning. Will try the cajun seasoning in the future.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;jaehi;5;Super tasty, super easy, super quick. Love it!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;imatechgirl;5;"Exactly my kind of recipe. I used Mrs Dash Herb & Garlic instead of cajun and it was a perfect compliment to the asparagus. I cut the asparagus into 1 1/2-2"" pieces and tossed it with 1 tsp of olive oil and a sprinkle of the Mrs Dash. 10 min in the oven and perfection!"
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;smurfe;4;This is basically the same way I cook asparagus. I wouldn't use no stick spray though as I do not like the flavor. Toss in a decent Extra Virgin Olive Oil in a bowl. Lightly sprinkle sea salt and fresh ground pepper and toss again. layer on baking sheet on some parchment paper, 10-12 minutes in a 425F oven depending on size of asparagus. Money! Sometimes for added flair I will sprinkle some fresh grated Parm cheese on and put back in oven a minute.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;ht;5;Shocked at how simple and delicous this is. That's my kind of recipe!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;carolyn;5;amazing!!! 5 stars. so easy and low cal.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;msmary;5;Funny that this was the first time making asparagus. I misread Cajun spice for cayenne powder so I used cayenne and it turned out great, especially since I served it with salmon patties with cayenne (I don't know if I'm spelling that right). It's very good with the lemon sauce from this site as well. Great simple recipe. Needs not exceed 10 mins.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;daschie;5;Have fixed this before, and my husband loves it. I use Zatarain's Creole Seasoning & Olive oil spray(just sprinkle over the top of the Asparagus)then toss to coat. It always turns out perfect! Thanks for such an easy recipe!!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;wandahankins;5;Loved it ! Even added some yellow squash slices and mayan sweets bell peppers around the sides of the pan, what a colorful tasty dish!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;careuhline;5;PERFECT idea!! I, too, left mine in for 15 minutes. I then turned off the oven sprinkled a bit of parmesan cheese on top before popping it back in for long enough for it to melt. Will definitely make this a regular in my kitchen!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;drseussfreak;4;Very good, I just prefer not to use the cajun seasoning.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;michellerothkiva;4;Not bad! My hubs and I liked this a LOT! While I enjoyed the cooking method (I LOVE the simplicity of roasted veggies!), what my hubs enjoyed most was the spicy Cajun flavor. Ironically enough, I could not taste ANY spice whatsoever! I could tell our asparagus were well-seasoned, but that's about it. :) A GENEROUS dose of sea salt AND some fresh cracked pepper would have been just as good, IMHO. NOTE: DO NOT spray your asparagus with cooking spray! Instead, drizzle with EVOO (flavored is even better!) and then add a few cloves of crushed or minced garlic, a sprinkling of grated Parmesan cheese and / or a squeeze of fresh lemon juice - the possibilities are endless! Served alongside Hudson's tilapia with dill sauce, this was GREAT! Thanks for sharing, MSLILLY. :-)
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;bcjangulo;5;Smeared the cooking surface with olive oil instead of spraying the asparagus with cooking spray. So yummy and so easy!!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;cora;5;Absolutely delish! I used olive oil in place of the non stick spray but followed the rest of the recipe. So easy and so worth it. Thanks for sharing.....
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;briannahildreth;4;Would be five stars IF recipe called for olive oil, which I did. Otherwise delicious
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;acharacterforu;5;so yummy and simple! who would of thought!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;veronica;1;pleae, don't prepare in this way! they must be snap at the tender, it's correct. After you must put them in hot salted water still they are one minute from the perfect cooked time. use a fork to controll. In a pan put a spoon of good butter and the asparagus, with a snow of parmigiano reggiano on them. Now they are perfectly cooked. Sorry for my english, I'm italian.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;janvierwashington;5;So yummy... used olive oil and creole seasoning, thats what I had..
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;tess;5;Yum is right!! Love it!!!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;kristyann40;4;very simple and yummy!!! I didn't have cooking spray so I used olive oil and Cajun seasoning!!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;drcattini;5;do half the allspice
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;donnawarrick;5;Perfect just the way it is!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;elainee;5;Very good. I think I added a couple minutes to the bake time.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;scmp;5;So awesome! I never knew roasted asparagus was so easy. I was shocked that in ten minutes they were cooked, and not still crunchy. They were perfect. I used salt, instead of cajun seasoning because i have a 4 year old. A+!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;marymac;5;Wonderful. 8 minutes for medium asparagus. The asparagus were firm, tender and still beautifully green.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;tricia;5;I was looking for a quick and delicious way to cook some asparagus, and this was perfect. I lined a sheet with aluminum foil first and sprayed with canola oil cooking spray. I used salt (sea salt grinder) / black pepper instead of cajun seasoning (not too big on spicy foods over here), and after 10 minutes in the oven, they came out PERFECT. I will be using this idea again and again.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;dagreatrochelle;5;I have never attempted asparagus prior to now, and I and my family found this to be delightful. I did however follow the advice of other reviewers and use olive oil in place of the non-stick cooking spray.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;nutfreemommy;5;Very good & easy!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;hotcocoa27;4;This was my first time eating asparagus. Really good and very easy.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;yahtzee63;5;Absolutely delicious -- could not be easier or quicker, and yet the results are top-notch. Served it to three different guests this week, each of whom raved about it. Used Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning Mix.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;christy819;5;Awesome. I did not think I would like, but it was great.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;mswright0905;5;My first time making Asparagus, it came out great, I was actually shocked at how easy this was, I just drizzled some olive oil and a little sea salt and they were wonderful!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;erosen820;5;Really yummy! The cajun spice made the asparagus as delicious as french fries.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;sarahmc;5;Another great way to fix asparagus!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;candacesullivan;5;Had no idea you could asparagus this way! It was delish! I used Vegetable Magic by Chef Paul on the asparagus! I use it on all my vegetables and its great!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;heidirobbinstighe;3;I was prepared to love this, but this recipe has a lot of heat and not much flavor. My family was quite disappointed that I made this instead of my standard butter/garlic/Parmesan asparagus. Adding grated cheese made it a bit better and saved the dish from being thrown away.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;stephaniev;5;Love this recipe as a great and quick easy asparagus dish. I do toss with a little EVO to coat the asparagus well before seasoning. Also if asparagus is thin I cook for a bit shorter than stated. My kids and husband love this! Thanks.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;kimscookingnow;4;Another easy step to make something ordinary taste extraordinary! I used olive oil spray rather than the cooking spray (as it taste much better). Roasted about 10 minutes - perfection. Loved it!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;tracy;5;This is the only way I cook asparagus now. Totally awesome, extremely easy and very fast. Just make sure that you don't overcook.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;kmpelham;5;I make this at least twice a week now... Love it!!! I switch up the spices too and use a garlic spice with garlic powder and olive oil and not one stalk is left over. Great Recipe :)
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;daliat;4;delicious! my hubby doesn't even like asparagus but ate it all up!!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;abby;5;Quick, easy and delicious.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;mrdrinky;5;I lined my sheet with tinfoil for easy clean-up.Definately easier & tastier than steamed!!!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;janna;5;Yummy and easy! What more could you ask for?
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;jasmin;5;This is fantastic! I followed other people's suggestions and added a little bit of olive oil before adding the cajun seasoning. SO GREAT! Thanks for sharing!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;maggiecglocalnet;5;Am not into asparagus! but this so good that I may start cooking them more often! thank you!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;amybroescheleonard;5;Deliciously easy! My 8 year old loved it and had seconds (twice).
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;tivomaniac;5;This is the only way to do asparagus. So easy and so quick!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;sarahmuma;4;I rubbed the asparagus in coconut oil, sprinkled with minced garlic and salt, baked at 425 for 13min... DELICIOUS! I could seriously munch on these instead of junk like potato chips. Only 4 stars because I didn't follow the recipe as written, thanks for the basics though!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;angkn;5;Excellent and yummy - I rubbed mine with olive oil before seasoning
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;godzilla;5;"I had to write a review for this because neither my eleven year old nor my husband really care for asparagus. Well, they ate these up. I did use Caribbean Jerk seasoning instead of Cajun. Absolutely fantastic. When an eleven year old requests asparagus again because ""they tasted too good to be a vegetable"" the recipe is a keeper! Thanks for the idea."
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;barbara;5;Love This Recipe.....I will never steam Asparague again !!!!!!!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;ceciliaj;5;This recipe is the BEST asparagus dish I have come across. SO EASY, yet everyone I have served it to RAVES about it. Follow directions just as written for foul-proof results
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;dianedavis;5;Soooo good! Will be roasting asparagus from now on, thank you! :)
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;kateheitstumandobson;5;I love cooking asparagus this way now! I just used salt, pepper and garlic instead of cajun seasoning but the spears were to die for! Hubby thought so too!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;lisa;3;I used a little evoo also. This was ok for something different but I won't be making it again.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;cook2relax;4;Quick, easy and great tasting! We were looking for something different to do with asparagus and this was a good change. Although it's not terribly creative it is tasty. Added garlic powder and cayenne to fit our tastes. Will make again.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;sylviakinnee;5;This is the very,very best way ever to cook asparagus. Having said that I must add that I drizzle it with olive oil and what ever seasoning goes with the menu.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;natty;5;Excellent.. any spice works turns out awesome and super fast
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;annie;5;really good, good with a little garlic salt instead of cajun (havn't tried cajun)
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;originalme;5;simple and quick. My go to recipe for asparagus
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;tinamarie;5;Simply perfect! Thanks.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;scorpiogg;5;I'm always a fan of good microwave recipes, especially the simpler ones like this one. If you're not an admirer of wine, use some white grape juice, apple juice, or it will work with just water and maybe a splash of lemon juice. Also, don't feel bashful about adding seasonings to your taste -- like a sprinkle of garlic salt, pepper and Parmesan cheese, for instance. Also, keep in mind that the 3 minutes microwave time makes for a crunchy asparagus, so if you and your family like a softer aspargus just zap it a little longer. With the ease of the microwave, some of it can be made crunchy and some softer -- nothing could be more simple.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;tmayder;5;Better than I expected! This is how I will cook asparagus from now on!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;barbhilton;5;This is sooo good and sooo easy.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;elizabethb;4;This was good, but too oily. I think I will use half the oil next time, as I like my asparagus a little crispy on the ends. I also substituted seasoned salt for Cajun seasoning and it had good flavor.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;mackman;5;this is so easy to prepare, and the result was delicious. I plan on using the technique in the future with different herbs and spices.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;mnarishap;5;This is my first time eating asparagus. I LOVED IT!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;suthrnmomma;5;I've made this a couple of times and followed the directions exactly each time. So easy, fast and delicious. Even my 5 year old eats it!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;susan;5;Excellent side dish, incredibly easy to prepare.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;chunkymonkey;5;One word for this recipe.....FABULOSO!!!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;jessicawarfield;5;I made this recipe, and it was great! I used Olive Oil and cooked it a little bit longer so the tops were crispy but the rest amazingly tender and sweet!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;robbie;4;This was a nice change of pace from regular ol' steamed asparagus. And the cajun spice was different too. Easy and fast, thanks!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;thebunnychef;4;This is such a good idea and I loved how fast it was to make! I used olive oil instead of the spray (though I'll try it that way too) and my Cajun seasoning was Messina's, which is made in New Orleans and has been my favorite seasoning since I was 10. Unfortunately I couldn't taste the asparagus at all because I have a terrible cold, but my husband said it was really good and I believe him. Can't wait to try it again next time asparagus is on sale (and when my taste buds are working again).
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;tabycat;5;This was a very easy recipe!! I used various seasonings to see which ones my kids liked best (we aren't cajun fans). Thanks!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;hoddie;5;We just adore this asparagus recipe, it's perfect. We don't buy Cajun seasoning, so we just use seasoning salt + cayenne pepper. It's always perfect every time - crisp and flavorful but never tough or chewy. 1 minute prep time + 10 minutes in the oven? You can't beat that!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;jessndon;5;Lower fAt thenwhat I use to do... Still great
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;bill;4;Very good basic recipe. I like the speed in which it is made. I usually use olive oil but tried the cooking spray and used Emeril's Cajun seasoning. The asparagrus came out great. I can see many variations of this recipe. Will definitely make again.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;mountsnowfish;4;Very good and easy. I added some garlic salt but the top came off and made it a bit to salty but still very tasty.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;angiehomeschoolmom;5;Very easy to make and delicious. Even my picky son likes it!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;footballgrl16;5;I made the pan fried version one night, and this oven version the next. I much prefered this recipe. I felt like it wasn't nearly as unhealthy and it had a perfect texture. You can definitely play with the spices to suit your tastes. Will keep in my recipes!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;carriekeller;5;"Great and ""superfast""! Thank You!!"
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;jennmaddie1;5;Awesome! Leaves the asaparagus with a nice crisp tender taste.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;tkfraz;5;Absolutely delicious. I used olive oil as suggested and only used half of the cajun seasoning because I don't like too strong flavorings...the family loved them. Thanks for the recipe!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;dawnpeacock;5;When I don't have Cajun seasoning, I use a combo of garlic salt and seasoned salt. Excellent!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;patricia;4;Very good dish, quick and easy to make, but don't over cook, best is slightly crunchy not mush.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;mummyjacks;4;Cooked very nicely for just 10 minutes, cajun spice was good, maybe a little too much spice.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;mounteajade;5;I rubbed the asparagus with a veggie seasoning and canola oil, and it tasted great too! Very easy and fast.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;amberella1964;5;BEST Asparagus recipe ever! I bake them in olive oil (basted on) and sprinkle them with parmesan cheese or cajun or lemon pepper :) depending on my mood. My roomie loves his with sweet chili sauce on top!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;naples34102;4;Excellent, but rather than cooking spray I used olive oil. I like roasted asparagus SO much better than just steaming it - it's more flavorful and also has a real robust look to it. This could be seasoned with any number of herbs and spices but Hubs and I really liked the Cajun seasoning - it was something I never would have thought to use with asparagus and it worked well. Ten minutes in the oven was perfect, and freed me up to tend to other things while it was roasting. I garnished it with zested lemon which was the perfect complement. Were it not for the cooking spray called for, I would have easily rated this 5-stars.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;joy;5;Perfect quick and easy side dish without all the grease. Used a generous amount of Tony's and some parmesan cheese. Yum!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;mileigh;5;Outstanding.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;colleen;5;Delicious, simple, and fast! Served this at a lunch I was hosting for my in-laws and everyone loved it!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;abd297;5;well, super easy, never thought it would be that good but it was. I have olive oil spray and just estimated the cajun seasoning. thanks
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;trinitymomma;4;Cajun seasoning made it super yummy I loved it!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;pauhonna;5;Asparagus with almost any seasoning is good, as long as the seasoning is not overdone. try it with a little Five Spice or Hoisin Sauce.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;novicecook;3;Really Tasty! I put the asparagus in tin foil with butter, the cajun seasoning and cinnamon as well. It tasted sweet and the spicy stayed on your tongue!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;tdfro;4;this is one of our staples at dinner.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;banslug;5;Easy, roasted exactly as the recipe called and it was perfect!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;larissasmith;5;Tasty and fast! I accidentally over cooked it a bit - but it was still yummy. I brushed it with a little melted butter and added a sprinkle of garlic salt. Definitely will be making it again!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;happyegrl;5;So quick and easy! My one year old eats asparagus thanks to this recipe! Even my husband who is anti-veggie loves them!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;lauraharris;5;Great recipe! I did add a little galic powder but I think you could probably sprinkle whatever you prefer and it would be grea! I snapped the ends off of the asparagus and put it a large ziploc bag,poured a little oil in the bag, sprinkled my seasonings in and shook it up. Just a little easier to get all of the ingredients mixed well. Pour it onto the pan and you're ready to go. Will definitely make it again, and again, and again.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;justlearning;5;I love this recipe. I make it at least once a week. It makes eating your veggies so easy and tasty.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;joanne;5;I used Zatarran's Creole seasoning and it turned out great! I like it even more than the normalolive oil/garlic pan fried asparagus and it is easier! Will make again.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;mg;5;Great idea! Very simple and less calories for you. Thanks for sharing!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;zoesmom;5;I was told by my 16 yr old son... MOM you need to make LOTS AND LOTS of this NEXT time! I sprayed with olive oil and sprinkled Tony's more spice. YUM!!!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;stephanie;3;No flavor. Not impressed.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;shelltur;5;Made this for dinner tonight. My husband is not a vegetable eater usually but tonight he ate a pound by himself!! Love the taste and how quickly it can be ready. This would be a great snack as well. Thanks!!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;asgray;5;EXCELLENT! My husband fixed the asparagus like this last night for dinner and I've never enjoyed asparagus more. We will cook it like this more often and will share the recipe as well.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;belled;3;I have made this many times, however, all I use is olive oil , salt and pepper. The cajun takes away some of the asparagus taste. Besides, not everyone likes cajun. IF any is left, I scramble a couple of eggs and make an omelet. Wow, is that good.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;sweetbasil;5;So love the asparagus in the spring!! I was making sweet potato fries so threw the asparagus in for the last 10 min. I'm a nut for Cajun seasoning so this was right up my alley. Thank you!!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;tonesq;5;This recipe is fabulous as is.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;kelly;5;Easy and delicious!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;missj;5;Great Recipe! So simple! I added a little shredded cheddar cheese and sprinkled some parmesan cheese. It was fabulous!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;jojod;5;My first attempt at cooking fresh asparagus. I was pleasantly surprised. Just added a little more Cajun seasoning because the family likes it spicy and I drizzled a little extra virgin olive oil on them before baking. Came out great, tender and very tasty.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;susieq;4;Tasty and easy!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;og;3;This recipe as is doesn't taste that impressive. I paired it with a garlic and butter sauce and it was decent.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;barb57;5;I sprayed butter flavored spray and sprinkled creole seasoning and baked for 10 min....then I added 10 minced cloves of garlic and continued baking for another 10 min. I used a 400 degree setting to accommodate the oven setting i was using for a chicken pot pie, thus the longer cooking time....came out PERFECT! I ate the entire batch myself!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;erinshepard;4;Awesome! A little too spicy, though.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;justshelly;5;I loved how fast and easy this was to make. My whole family loved it.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;christy247;5;Love how simple and quick this was. The cajun spices a perfect compliment!

87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;kth91;5;Excellent! Definitely use Creole seasoning instead of Cajon,(more like the restaurants asparagus) or just use Sea Salt
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;alk02g;5;I used Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning, and just sprinkled some on, didn't bother measuring out a teaspoon. was a great way to cook up a fast vegetable, and asparagus is popular in our house so will make it that was again.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;sueanneggermont;5;Fast easy simple just what I was looking for and yummy!

87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;wyattdogster;5;The asparagus was perfectly cooked and tender, and a recipe doesn't get any easier than this! Thanks, we loved it!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;smb181989;4;It was a little too spicy for me, but that is way I made it as a side dish to Picante Chicken for my husband. He loved it. Defiantly easy and quick a perfect side.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;mwiessner;5;super fast and super yummy! i also coated in olive oil and added some garlic powder to the seasoning. very very good! much easier than waiting on the steamer!

87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;emilyanderson;5;I couldn't believe how easy this was. I used Tony Chachere's. Tastes as good as grilled asparagus.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;momma2kinsey;5;Found this in a rush and it was wonderfully easy and even my husband liked it, who really doesn't care much for asparagus!

87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;foxylady;5;I prepared this dish for Christmas it was delicious and simple.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;jessigrrrl24;5;"my stars are more for the process of cooking than the spices because I didn't have ""cajun"" seasoning. The asparagus was perfectly tender without being mushy or anything. So easy. I topped with salt and parm. cheese."
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;mrsjgb;5;This is the only way I will do asparagus from here on out...it is perfect! I did sprinkle it with a little parmesean when it was done. Thank you for this easy recipe! :o)
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;cookiecutter;2;I rate this recipe as just okay. I didn't think the Cajun seasoning complemented the asparagus
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;angiehibbardwright;3;Wonderful idea but the cajun seasoning did overpower the asparagus as another suggested. The next time i used garlic powder, drizzled with bacon grease from bacon cooked that morning and I also cooked them a little longer. I will always cook my asparagus this way from now on. Thanks!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;yohan215;5;very yummy
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;jessica;5;This recipe was sooo simple. We don't ever eat asparagus in my family, so we were skeptic but everyone loved it! I rubbed the asparagus down with a little bit of olive oil first instead of spraying it. I will definitely make this again.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;cyndumont;5;Lovely!! I had no cajun spice so I used garlic powder and seasoning salt. I ate the whole thing myself!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;kitten112481;5;Thank you for this easy recipe. I never really liked asparagus until I started fixing it this way. For my variation, I drizzle the asparagus with extra light tasting olive oil, and then did the cajun seasoning, sea salt, and cracked black pepper, and tossed all of that together, then dumped it onto the baking sheet. Came out great!!!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;lorinne;5;This turned out great!! I used my own seasonings (garlic blend, salt & pepper), and was SO pleased! I love asparagus, and have never been able to cook it well, no matter what method I tried. This turned out PERFECT!!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;jjm;2;"I didn't care for these at all. I'm not a huge fan of asparagus, but my husband is. I used the ""simple cajun seasoning"" from this site, which I found pretty tasteless actually!"
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;dariusriley;4;Quick and easy. Very tasty.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;lisaspann;5;good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;vgarg;5;So good and like the recipe name, super fast! I usually steam my asparagus but roasting it with cajun seasoning gave it much more flavor. I coated the spears with olive oil spray and turned the spears halfway through. Thanks for the recipe!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;yvette;5;So GOOD! Simple, easy to make and even the kiddies will like it!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;kadensmom;5;DELICIOUS! And SO easy!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;jess13dc;4;I never really liked asparagus but for some reason made this anyway, and it's really yummy! I easily ate it all by myself though, so I definitely disagree that this is supposed to serve 3. I used a sheet of foil so there's basically no clean up. It's cheap and wildly easy so I'll definitely make again.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;photobenson;5;love how quick and easy this is
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;jaime;5;GREAT!!! don't add oil, you don't need it.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;stacie;4;Good but my asparagus came out very stringy. I'm not sure if that's the asparagus or the preparation or both.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;colleen;5;Used Creole Seasoning. Very good.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;jpallen;5;Superfast and super delicious! Great recipe - simple and savory!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;sharonc;5;We love asparagus, and I was looking for a quick recipe. Read the reviews, tried this, added a tiny bit of garlic salt (Cajun seasoning has salt in it, so can't use too much), and we loved it. I've had asparagus in really expensive restaurants that did not taste as good as this. My husband raved about it. Thank you so much for this recipe. I will most definitely use this recipe often!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;salma;5;So fast and tastes excellent. I added crushed red pepper as well.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;helpmecook82;5;"Love it! I'm a huge fan of asparagus but this was the first time I'd cooked it myself, without it being canned or frozen. It was so super easy-- I will ALWAYS go with fresh asparagus from now on! And I used the ""Simple Cajun Seasoning"" recipe on this site. I recommend using that rather than buying packaged seasoning. Very glad I discovered this ridiculously easy recipe!"
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;emilyh;5;This was AMAZING! I made it with ocean perch, so I cooked my asparagus at 350 instead for 15 min. I also, per the other reviews used a pinch of garlic salt all over, and then lightly lightly sprinkled it with mozarella shredded cheese after it was done cooking. However, it probably didn't need it...even though it was wonderful! The cajun seasoning with the asparagus is SO good, I don't even care for asparagus and it may be a favorite now.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;sowens;5;I never ate asparagus before. I thought I would try out this recipe and it was sooo good! Will make at least twice a week!!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;roon;5;Superfast and superspicy! I think I used too much seasoning as I didn't adjust for having less asparagus. Still like it though, great idea, thanks!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;simone;5;Fantastic!!!used 1 1/2 lbs london broil seasoned w/ steak seasoning.used 1 can tomato, 1 can cream of mushroom soup, but only half of the o-soup, added some canned mushrooms, red wine and one small minced onion.it took about 7 hrs in my crockpot---soooo good!!!after i took out meat, i added some cream to the gravy--because i'm german and thats what we do lol. served this with mashed potatoes as well as asparagus roasted in garlic and olive oil---this will be a staple in our house.planning on trying this w/ elk as well.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;jessiekuhn;5;It feels strange to give something with two ingredients five stars, but it was so easy and tasty you wouldn't have known it was only two ingredients. My husband is a little biased against veggies, but he ate this and LIKED IT!! Great idea. I think I will try Cajun seasoning on other veggies too!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;jenniferberndt;5;Easy, crisp, and delicious! I rubbed the spears with olive oil instead of the spray.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;sunnyb75;5;My husband ate these first! I had three spears before I left the kitchen.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;tyjacs;5;I love these when they get crisp! So easy and very, very good!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;summerpls;5;This was wonderful ... still a little crispy and very tasty.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;samantha;5;My husband hates asparagus, but even he admitted that this is the tastiest asparagus he's ever had! I had to cook the asparagus a bit more, took me about about 25 mins in the oven, but I prefer my asparagus a little on the softer side rather than crisp. Will definitely make again!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;ganther;5;The cajun spice was perfect and the spary was just enough. I had previously added butter and they got too mushy.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;bamamandy;5;This was the best asparagus I've ever eaten! Some of the smaller pieces got a little crisy, which was wonderful.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;kbake;5;I didn't have cajun seasoning so I used a lemon pepper seasoning instead, the lemon gave a little zest and the pepper a little spice. Baking with the seasoning turned out great! Wasn't oily like sauteeing and will definately try different styles in the future! Thanks for the idea!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;yorkiemommy;5;Great recipe. Very easy, very fast, added a little kosher salt and followed the directions exactly. Thanks!!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;sunydaze;5;Loved how quick and easy this was. I used a light olive oil spray and added sea salt and fresh ground pepper.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;veroelena;5;Super yummy recipe - who knew? I sprayed with olive oil to make it a bit more South Beach friendly, and my husband and I ate them up! Thanks!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;marysimondssavage;5;This is the best asparagus I have ever had, and it is super easy to make -- definitely no way to screw it up. The only change I made was to drizzle a bit of melted butter over the top.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;deniseanne;2;The cajun spice takes away the flavor of the asparagus.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;dmaw234;5;I don't usually like asparagus all that much, but this was really good! And it's super easy.

87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;cnmcatering;5;Everybody loved this! I coated asparagus with olive oil like others suggested. nice and tender. i will definately make this again. thanks!

87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;aspiringchefrita;5;Love this-Superfast is right-to make it faster-just line your baking sheet with aluminum foil. When cooked I put them in storage bags to take for lunch-they are great both warmed up or cold.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;christinag;4;My husband said this needed some garlic salt. Otherwise, very easy, good flavor.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;kaniger;5;Simply excellent! Who would have thought? I sprayed with a little olive oil spray, sprinkled with sea salt and roasted (along side pork tenderloins and red potatoes) for about 10 minutes. Perfect.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;ucoolpsych;4;Very, very good. Easy. Will make again.
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;kristytackett;5;This was awesome!!! I've been cooking asparagus in olive oil and garlic, but it has been a little too oily for me. I followed the recipe by spraying it with olive oil spray and I sprinkled on Tony Chachere's creole seasoning. I baked it more than 10 minutes since we like our asparagus a little on the softer side. After about 13 minutes I put it in a small baking dish and finely grated some white sharp cheddar cheese on top. The oven was still warm so I popped it in and melted the cheese. It was GREAT!
87cdbf71-6735-4cfc-b4e7-1c09bf698fff;loddiecheftress;5;I rubbed olive oil then the cajun seasonings... Really good flavor and very fast! Veggies are still firm and full of flavor. Who would have thought it to be this simple and tasty!
4a856c96-afcc-4391-a5d2-befdf0e9337d;habenaroman;5;"Great. I also sliced about 1/3"" thick. I may add a little cinnamon next time. Wondering how that might taste."
4a856c96-afcc-4391-a5d2-befdf0e9337d;davecronkrite;5;"Wow, this was so easy, and it turned out great. I cut them 1/3"" thick, as someone suggested, and I used mesquite on a wood grill, but followed the gas grill instructions. Buttered, salt and pepperred on the plate, fantastic! I bet it's also wonderful with butter and brown sugar. Just not for this diabetic."
4a856c96-afcc-4391-a5d2-befdf0e9337d;luann;5;Excellent recipe
4a856c96-afcc-4391-a5d2-befdf0e9337d;greenday;5;The easiest butternut squash recipe ever! Slice, baste and grill! No peeling I'm sold on this recipe. I had Italian dressing handy basting other veggies so I basted with that. Awesome! Thank you for sharing.
4a856c96-afcc-4391-a5d2-befdf0e9337d;evans;4;Very good recipe, and easy to make. Since the steps in the recipe are not detailed, I'll add a few tips. It's better to use a squash that has a smaller seed bulb, as when slicing the bulb you will get rings or crescents, which can fall through the grill grates if you're not careful. I sliced the squash into 1/2 inch thick rounds, and would probably do 1/3 inch next time. I preheated the grill to high, and then lowered heat to medium after putting the squash on, to keep them from burning on the outside before cooking on the inside. They don't really need any sauce or seasoning. We opted for some pepper jelly and salt, which was delicious.
4a856c96-afcc-4391-a5d2-befdf0e9337d;buckwheatqueen;5;The simplest things are truly the best! Thank you for the recipe.
261405c6-9555-4645-80c2-363adb9b03be;yoly;3;I knew 1/2 cup of skim milk would be too much so I only added 1/2 tbs. Like soft serve but not creamy and all I could taste were the bananas. I then added 2 tbs peanut butter, 1 tbs heavy whipping cream and 1/2 tsp vanilla. Very good with these changes.
261405c6-9555-4645-80c2-363adb9b03be;teamcupcakes;3;I have done something similar before because I love banana ice cream. I use at least half that much milk. And since regular milk has sugar in it, I have used unsweetened almond milk. To make it sweeter I have added whipped cream and even less milk or regular vanilla soy milk. If you do not freeze the bananas, before and again chilling the mixture after mixing, you will end up with a smoothie.
261405c6-9555-4645-80c2-363adb9b03be;sara;2;Was sadly disappointed. It was not the thickness or tdxture of ice cream and was not at all adaptable. I didn't have frozen bananas so i added ice when i blended it. It was a smoothie,not ice cream. The name should ve changed.
261405c6-9555-4645-80c2-363adb9b03be;halfblood;4;It's a great recipe, although a bit runny. I switched it up a bit, I used one banana, half a cup of pineapple, 1/4 cup of milk. And let it sit in the freezer for about 10 minutes.
261405c6-9555-4645-80c2-363adb9b03be;tammylynn;3;"This is OK. I would like mine to be more frozen or thicker since you are calling it ""ice cream."" I even added one more frozen banana. It was more like a smoothie. I think 1/4 c milk would be more than enough next time. The taste was fine. I often just mix banana and milk for a breakfast drink. But since I was hoping for a frozen treat, I went ahead and put it in the freezer and will take it out in a bit. *Update: I put it in the freezer for a couple hours, and the consistency was much better. I took two photos--one before freezing and one after."

1ed28454-56d0-440f-b86b-5b44963f7b19;krazykat;5;This is a great recipe. I put sliced lemon in the bottom with the whole garlic cloves bay leaf and salt. I added chokes then poured water over the top.

1ed28454-56d0-440f-b86b-5b44963f7b19;karensmith;4;Scaled recipe down for 1 artichoke and 1/4 cup of water was not enough.
1ed28454-56d0-440f-b86b-5b44963f7b19;chriskellyeagle;4;Definitely needed to add more cooking time.. It took about another 10 mins to cook to tender. (2) Artichokes cooked in the 6 qt
1ed28454-56d0-440f-b86b-5b44963f7b19;erin;4;10 minutes plus natural release was not long enough for 1 large artichoke. I had to put it back in.
1ed28454-56d0-440f-b86b-5b44963f7b19;julieligonkernstein;4;I truly love artichokes! But the traditional way of making them takes forever. I love the ease of using the pressure cooker. As written, this recipe is ok. I've been using a similar recipe for a couple years now. Trim and wash as directed, place them face up in the pot, squeeze 1/2 to a whole lemon over them and then sprinkle with lemon pepper seasoning and garlic powder (or garlic salt if you prefer). Snap the lid into place and cook on high pressure for 10 minutes. Delicious!
1ed28454-56d0-440f-b86b-5b44963f7b19;bren;3;I found this rather bland. If I were to make this again I would tuck the garlic into the artichokes and sprinkle the salt over them. The lemon can only be tasted in the very centre and is a little bitter. They weren't done after 10 minutes so I put the lid back on and and cooked them for another 2 minutes.
98f38a0e-34c7-42de-8558-a9377aa7c00b;gagandeepkaur;5;I added only soya sauce instead of all. Loved it very much... Also added some salt to taste and some herbs.. Its really delicious. Will make it again
98f38a0e-34c7-42de-8558-a9377aa7c00b;shelleyg8r;5;Easy and delicious.
98f38a0e-34c7-42de-8558-a9377aa7c00b;natascha;4;I doubled the Sauce, and added pak choi. Served it with tempura breaded fish and rice...
98f38a0e-34c7-42de-8558-a9377aa7c00b;amandatipton;5;sooo good, i have made it numerous times

I have every intention of making this again (possible w/ the addition of chicken, tofu or shrimp to make it more of an entree) as it was easy and delicious, and I'll be sure to track down fresh baby corn, or at the very least use a more interesting mushroom than the baby bellas that I got on sale. The only other change was sprinkling w/ crushed red pepper flakes. We were very surprised at how wonderful this turned out to be!"
98f38a0e-34c7-42de-8558-a9377aa7c00b;robbyh;3;Good recipe
98f38a0e-34c7-42de-8558-a9377aa7c00b;darzar;5;Right away I knew I wanted to make these because they feature my husband's favorite: baby corn. This recipe is so easy, and tastes like you just got it at the corner mom & pop Chinese joint. So quick, easy and economical, thanks for sharing, we will make this again!
98f38a0e-34c7-42de-8558-a9377aa7c00b;kac911;4;Added carrots as well. Made a nice side dish. The cilantro really gave it a nice flavor.
98f38a0e-34c7-42de-8558-a9377aa7c00b;justjam;2;as i've said before.. i hate giving out less than stellar reviews.. but this was just very salty in my opinion.. the ONLY thing i did differently was halving the onion b/c that's all i had.. maybe i'll make some steamed rice and give this to bf for his lunch tomorrow since he'll eat just about anything
98f38a0e-34c7-42de-8558-a9377aa7c00b;rexhutcheson;5;4-27-13: Really good. Used frozen corn, not baby corn. 10-18-13: Pretty good.
98f38a0e-34c7-42de-8558-a9377aa7c00b;florence;4;I was pleasantly surprised! :-)When I made it, it turned out dark and suspicious looking (LOL), but the taste was truly excellent.
98f38a0e-34c7-42de-8558-a9377aa7c00b;keeli;4;Great low-cal, low-fat side with some asian glazed fish, but we found the fish sauce, soy, and oyster sauses to be over poweringly dark and salty so added a bit of rice vinegar and mirin to lighten it up
98f38a0e-34c7-42de-8558-a9377aa7c00b;simplyjmay;4;Yummy. I add chicken to make this a main dish.
98f38a0e-34c7-42de-8558-a9377aa7c00b;lanayasongerbryant;4;Very good. Only thing was it was a bit too salty for me. I couldn't find fish sauce, so I used worcestershire sauce instead. I will make it again.
98f38a0e-34c7-42de-8558-a9377aa7c00b;mommyluvs2cook;5;I made this a while ago and forgot to rate it. Very good! I like mushrooms and I like baby corn so I loved this!
98f38a0e-34c7-42de-8558-a9377aa7c00b;beckee;5;Very good!!!
98f38a0e-34c7-42de-8558-a9377aa7c00b;philly6288;5;I didn't use the corn, red chile pepper or cilantro because I didn't have any on hand. I followed all the other steps as written. Tasted delicious
98f38a0e-34c7-42de-8558-a9377aa7c00b;carlyurbanskijohnson;4;This turned out to be a very nice, light, tasty side dish. Browning the garlic really added flavor! Used chili paste in the sauce instead of an actual pepper as topping as some have recommended. Omitted the cornstarch mix in due to the sauce having a nice consistency already.
98f38a0e-34c7-42de-8558-a9377aa7c00b;stephaniecapecchi;4;"Delicious, and definitely a recipe I would make again. The best part is, this sauce base could be used with all sorts of meat and veggies. To be fair, here are the changes I made: chili sauce instead of the chili pepper; added 2 small chicken breasts, which made it a main dish and also gave it a good flavor."
98f38a0e-34c7-42de-8558-a9377aa7c00b;wmihalo;5;I thought this was a great recipe. I skipped the corn starch and extra water. The liquid released by the mushrooms and the soy, fish and oyster sauces provided plenty. I added a small can of diced (mild) chile peppers. The next time I make this recipe, I will double it and make 8 servings.
98f38a0e-34c7-42de-8558-a9377aa7c00b;eacline;5;Delicious. I had no fish sauce so substituted two parts soy to one part lime juice. Also had no chiles so I threw in a little crushed red pepper. Left out the cilantro.
98f38a0e-34c7-42de-8558-a9377aa7c00b;kristonscott;5;"I made this as a side dish for the ""Barbequed Thai-Style Chicken"" recipe. It complemented it quite well!"
98f38a0e-34c7-42de-8558-a9377aa7c00b;nrsejessica;4;This was delicious!!!! My husband thought it was good but not great but I however loved it! I've been trying to find a good asian stir fry veggie recipe to go with the Baked Teriyaki Chicken from this site! The changes I made were adding more garlic because I love it! I also used canned baby corn because I couldn't find any fresh & have never seen it fresh. I left out the fish sauce since I didn't have any so what I did was use 2TBSP soy sauce to make up for it, I also used 2TBSP oyster sauce since I added fresh broccoli to the dish & it needed more sauce. I also used red pepper flakes while stir frying since I didn't have any chili pepper. It was good my only complaint was I think I will add less cornstarch or leave it out all together next time. I know the sauce is suppose to thicken up a bit to stick but it was a little too thick for me. But still very good!
98f38a0e-34c7-42de-8558-a9377aa7c00b;hanna;4;I liked this recipe, my husband said it was just ok. To be fair, I did have to make a lot of changes: 1. To make the recipe kosher, I omitted both the fish sauce and oyster sauce. I subbed the 2 of them with 1 tablespoon soy sauce. 2. When I went to cut up my mushrooms it turned out they were spoiled, so I had to use canned instead. I also used canned baby corn. 3. I threw in some cubed chicken cutlets to make a full meal. 4. I added some crushed red pepper flakes instead of the red chile pepper. I also left out the cilantro. Overall it was good but not 5 stars. I will try it again using fresh mushrooms. EDIT: Tonight I made it again using fresh mushrooms- made a world of difference. I also used 2 Tb soy sauce and 1 Tb Worcestershire for the fish+oyster+soy sauce, which also made a huge difference. I added 4 chicken cutlets like last time but left the sauce the same and it was still enough. Used dried instead of fresh cilantro. Overall a healthy, filling, and tasty meal!
98f38a0e-34c7-42de-8558-a9377aa7c00b;souplovingnicole;5;I really liked this and wouldn't change a thing next time. I did use can baby corn because that is all I have available here.
98f38a0e-34c7-42de-8558-a9377aa7c00b;molle888;5;This was absolutely delicious! I had never used fresh baby corn, but I found some at Wegman's and decided to give this a try. I also added one bok choy to the mix, and used low sodium soy sauce. The end result was so good! Thanks for this!
98f38a0e-34c7-42de-8558-a9377aa7c00b;bskaf;5;This was a good low calorie dish! I added two chicken breasts chicken and used two cans of baby corn so I doubled the sauces to make sure there was enough. I used shiitake mushrooms which were good but will try others next time.
98f38a0e-34c7-42de-8558-a9377aa7c00b;cookinbug;5;Yum! I did omit the chili pepper as I didn't have one on hand, but I sprinkled with crushed red pepper flakes while cooking to add a little spice. This tastes a lot like the mushroom side dish I always order at my favorite Chinese restaurant. Thanks :)
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;cassandrasignorelli;4;Quick and easy. Glad I chose this recipe as this was my 1st time making it. Scrolled through comments before and added an onion as well. Next time I’ll add bay leaves :)
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;samanthaprokop;5;Made this soup and it was absolutely delicious!! I did add sautéed onions with a teaspoon of cumin! I would make it again and again!
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;ang;5;Made this for the first time, was looking for a recipe that did not have ham in it. Made exactly as it called for except I didn’t use celery. Came out perfect, nice and thick how I wanted it. Will definitely make again!
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;pattijuarezsantoyo;5;Easy to make and everyone loves it!
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;andyl;5;I doubled the amount of carrots for added texture - very good.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;agrayson;5;"Such a simple, delicious soup! This works well in my family group for several reasons: it's low in calories; it's 'vegetarian' (I still use chicken broth) and everyone likes it!! I make it as is-- although I do add salt. Otherwise, this recipe is perfect. Thanks for sharing it!!"
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;judisampsonyoung;5;I love this recipe. It's extremely simple to make and delicious. I am reducing my meat intake and looking for ways to keep my iron and protein levels healthy. I made the recipe the way it was written the first time, but now I add finely chopped onions and garlic for additional flavor. I have also omitted the chicken broth. Yum!!!
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;nicolet818;4;Good healthy recipe, but I'm only giving it 4 stars because I felt it needed some modifications. Like some other reviews suggested, I added a whole red onion, used 2 stalks of celery, and 5 cloves of minced garlic (I love garlic). I sauteed all the veggies and garlic in some olive oil until the onion was soft. Then added the broth, peas, 2 bay leaves, some thyme & rosemary, salt and pepper. I simmered for about 2 hrs 45 min to get the right consistency.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;mrslisaj;5;I made it! I loved it! At the end I made a bèchamel sauce and mixed it with a hand blender. It made it thicker and richer. Thank you!!!
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;lakokoloko;5;I added one onion and garlic. Tastes great!
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;aylamcconnell;5;I doubled the recipe and sautted an onion with bacon! I added bay leaves and garlic powder too, turned out amazing!
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;silent;5;My family adored this soup. It was filling and every savory. I mentioned I would be making it this week, and my ten year old start ed begging for it tonight. A definite repeat in my house.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;susanattridge;5;I followed others' suggestions and added sauteed onions. I also used sea salt and some smoked paprika and let it simmer for 2 to 2 1/2 hours. We are having it tonight on a stormy evening with olive sourdough. delicious!
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;reneereade;4;Great base recipe. After reading some comments I also made changes. I used organic vegetable stock and no water or chicken stock, added some garlic seasoning and pacific sea salt. Needs to cook at least 3 hrs. If you have an immersion blender use it on this! Soup comes out nice and thick after blended.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;mdg500;4;I loved it. The kids did not. Neither did my mother. I guess I used too much pepper!
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;gisele;3;The recipe worked out okay the only thing I will do differently next time is not add the carrots, it made the soup sweet, and took the Pea soup taste away, but it is a good recipe if you would like pea soup and can't have the pork in it
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;stephaniegutschall;5;This soup is surprisingly delicious even though it's basic with minimal ingredients. I used three carrots and two stalks of celery. It was delicious!
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;mappleg8;4;Left it the same for the most part just added a few herbs really enjoyed it!
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;jennieqg;5;VERY GOOD. Used two 32 oz chicken broth. Used some water but less than 2 cups. Also used more celery and carrots.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;piscesgiraffe;5;The soup turned out great, very thick and hearty. I did modify the recipe a bit, though. I soaked the peas overnight first. I also added 1 large Russet potato (chopped, but not too small) and 1/2 large onion. I also added a bit of garlic powder and some oregano. I only added about 1/4 tsp of salt, since I am on a low sodium diet. I thought it turned out very flavorful. I cooked it for 1 1/2 hours on med-low heat, after the initial boiling.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;shaval123;5;Very nice pea soup. I added half a bunch of chopped fresh dill (you can also use dry dill) and this bumped it up even more. I have tried this is slow cooker for 5 hours on high and works great also.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;sharonarolston;5;I added 8 cups of water-no broth. I added double the veggies chopped in the cuisinart. I also added 3 potatoes chopped in the cuisinart. I learned adding the potatoes that I rarely nave to blend before serving. I bring to a boil, cover and simmer most of the afternoon (about 5 hours). I season with pepper, garlic granules,bay leaf and fresh rosemary. When I have company I do add some sea salt--no added salt for just us. This base recipe is the best. I agree with C Turner it is a lot like the Pea Soup Anderson's recipe.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;jmscotty;4;Very simple to make and was good! I think it needed some other seasoning besides just salt and pepper but it still was a good recipe.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;connieo;2;1 point for ease of preparation. 1 point for liquid to pea ratio. 0 points for flavor. There are a lot of more flavorful split pea soup recipes on AR. I made it exactly as stated.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;debbiereboin15;4;We really liked this. Came out great!
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;michelepeterson;5;"I wanted a truly vegetarian split pea soup and this was easily modified without changing the essential recipe, so even though I made changes, I still rate this 5 stars -- I am quite certain that made as written it would be a 5 star recipe. I substituted a Knorr Homemade Vegetable stock tub for the chicken broth, increasing the water accordingly (total liquid added was 6 cups, and I added another cup and half during cooking as it was becoming quite thick). The soup came out very very thick after about 90 minutes of simmering. The peas broke down nicely and it would have been good as is, but I used my immersion blender to puree it more. I also added a bit more seasonings than the salt the pepper -- I added Smoked Spanish Paprika and some celery seeds, as well a few drops of Liquid Smoke to give it that ""something something"" that was missing with no ham in it. It's a pretty easy soup to prep, most of the time is spent ""hands off"" simmering. Once refrigerated it thickens up more so I add more liquid as I reheat some soup through the week. It became almost never-ending!!"
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;cindy;5;Yummmm. I used a whole onion in the recipe, and doubled the celery it called for. I also soaked the peas over night, and only needed to cook it for about an hour. It came out nice and thick. At one point I needed to add some extra water, because it was starting to burn. I added some smoked sea salt to mimic the smokey meaty flavor. I will definitely use this recipe again. As a vegetarian, finding a good pea soup with no meat in it is a challenge. I will make mine home made from now on.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;sandi149;4;I made this last night and it was really good but I would definitely use all chicken broth and add much more of it as it comes out way too thick. As the soup sits, it gets very thick so even with the leftovers you will have to add more broth. total broth was about 2 qts. if you cut the amount of split peas, then you can use less broth. I would make this again!
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;litegal1;5;Absolutely phenomenal (yeah, yeah - I know - I spelleded that wrong). Only change was to a) add a little onion b) saute all veggies in olive oil first, c) added a bit of curry powder and finally d) pureed about half of mix for thicker texture. What a great vitamin packed healthy meal.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;auntstar;4;Good basic. Like many others have said, spice it up and cook it longer. I added shredded chicken.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;jlo;5;"Absolutely thick & delicious. I used my own home-made ""vege-rosemary-chicken broth"" along with a couple bay leaves as another reviewer had suggested. Also included shredded chicken & diced sweet potato to the recipe. Topped with a couple dashes of tobasco when in my bowl which gave it an extra lil' pizzaz. Very Tastey. Will definitely make again."
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;krimac;5;Really easy recipe, but as other reviewers stated to thicken it up, I used a can of cream of chicken in place of 1 cup of water, I also added curry (by accident at first) and it turns out the curry really adds some flavor. smidgen of celery salt as well. Other than that I didn't soak the peas as the recipe didn't say so, but turned out really awesome. Thank you so much :)
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;cookiecooker;5;Fantastic! Nice & low calorie too. I added a little onion and thyme. Next time I will add way more carrots because I love them! I subbed veggie broth over chicken.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;a5hlyn;3;Not amazing but decent and fast.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;auntiej;4;Very nice. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken and added some diced ham at the very end. Cut the water back to 2 cups and then added more near the end to get the consistency I wanted.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;torleemylove;5;Made this for our first snow day of the year!!!! So good and so easy...I also added smoked turkey wings, a couple of chicken herb ox cubes and a few garlic cloves when the soup was done I took out the smoked turkey wings and added the diced meat back in the soup!!!!
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;tncollegegirl;5;awesome~
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;jesslynn;5;I make this soup all of the time and we love it - even my somewhat picky husband and toddler! I made it after having a split pea and barley soup at California Pizza Kitchen. This tastes just like it. I add a little onion and thyme, and half an hour before the end of cooking, half a cup of barley. It's hearty, very tasty, and I love the chewey nutty flavor of the barley. I cook it for up to three hours, and it is never too watery for me. If anything, it is a little too thick. The barely, of course, absorbs some of the liquid. This is a must try recipe!
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;katy;4;Really good base recipe. I added more spices per other reviewers. Sauteed some garlic, onions, carrots and celery in olive oil. Than added the broth, water and split peas and it took about 3 hours to cook down. Good consistency if you just let it cook.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;beccabombshell;5;I really found this to be a great, hearty soup. I cooked it for around an 1 1/2 hours and the peas really boiled down nicely. I also added 1/2 a diced onion (which boils down right into the soup) and Paprika spice. Its amazing how well the peas and paprika go together! great soup to have handy on those rainy days. Thanks for sharing!
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;jchiulli;5;Excellent. I too added 2 slices of cut bacon, about half an onion, omitted celery, garlic powder, PC rosemary seasoning and used vegetable stock instead of chicken broth. I was not a fan of split pea soup prior. But made it for my son. I am now a fan and will would make it again and again! (No need to saute the veggies before hand. I just through everything in a pot and let it simmer.)
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;fithealthymom;3;Good basic soup, not great. I sautéed onion, celery and carrots with olive oil and I also added a bay leave. It turned out very thick and filling.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;kate;5;A great basic recipe for a winter day.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;calicook;5;Yum! I made this soup and my husband said he didn't like split pea soup, but he ate two bowls once he tasted it. It cooked down to a perfect thickness in just under 2 hours. I did add an onion and minced garlic and sautéed it all in olive oil first as some suggested. We loved it- healthy and delicious.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;bellydancer;5;I have been hungry for split pea soup, this sure hit the spot! I added garlic and a bay leaf, simmered for an hour or so. It turned very thick at the end, so I guess next time I shouldn't simmer quite so long. I'm sure to make this often over the long winter months.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;az;4;There is such a thing as good pea soup that doesn't have pork in it. I do like a little bit of a richer flavor, so I added 1/2 and onion and a clove of garlic the the other veggies. One thing about split pea soup is that to get it thick you really have to cook it. Every stove is a little different -cooking time was fine, and so was the liquid amount, you just have to figure out what level simmer you need.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;kermit4608;5;Having Celiac disease, I was excited to find this delicious recipe. It came out very well. Super easy, inexpensive to make, and lasted a long time. Great soup.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;donnagould;5;This is so easy and very economical. I did cut back on the water and added a few more seasonings to give the flavor a boost (pinch of garlic salt and sage). Very yummy!
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;barbarellabda;5;This was delish and so easy! I replaced chicken broth with 4 cups of veggie broth instead (cubed bouillion and water version) added a 1/4 cup of dry white wine and some finely chopped onion simmered very slowly stirring on occassion. It was wonderfully thick and my family loved it!
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;marybear;5;I make my split pea almost the exact same way. I add half an onion and 1-2 cloves of garlic. I cheat with the carrots and buy the shredded ones. Works great! Some people like it smooth. For a different texture you can put it through a blender in batches. If the soup is too watery (there are two styles), it cooks down rather rapidly. Just know that thick left over split pea soup will look a lot like Campbell's Condense. You'll have to add water. :)
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;jstar99;5;Very Good. I added about half of a small chopped white onion, a couple tbs. minced garlic, and a tbs thyme to add more flavor. I had to let it simmer for about 2 1/2 hours to get it thick
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;libbyeisbutler;5;This was very good. It was great to have a soup without the pork. I added onion and extra carrots, yum!
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;joyofjesussmileymom;4;So easy, and even the baby ate it. I left half the peas out, then added them halfway through the cooking time to have some peas still recognizable.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;jackie;4;Very good. I let it simmer an extra long time and had to add water from time to time but it turned out nice and thick.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;kaye;5;Loved it! Had absolutely no problem with it cooking down and creating a nice thick split pea soup without all the fat and salt of adding pork.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;lolo69;4;This is a great simple recipe. I did a bit of tweeking. Sauted onions, sweet pepper, garlic, chives, thyme, and celery in some evoo before adding the chicken stock ans peas. I also added a 1/4 teaspoon of geram masala. My soup was ready in under and hour as HINT: I SOAKED THE PEAS IN WATER OVERNIGHT!(2 times as much water as peas, throwing off the original water when i was ready to cook) this will help with cooking times and cause the peas to reach the desired consistency faster/more easily
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;catpurrson;5;Great soup. Simple and delicious. I did add a bit of bacon and some seasonings. It was THICK and hearty. I believe the trick is to not rush it and it thickens beautifully.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;cturner;5;As simple as this recipe was, it was delicious! My family felt like it was at least equal to Pea Soup Andersons' (the actual restaurant). I think I might have used more broth than water. But the trick is to blend the whole thing once it's done cooking. That makes it so creamy and yummy.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;jennifer;4;I used less water and broth (about 3 1/2 cups total), added thyme and garlic. Delicious and ridiculously easy.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;colley411;4;WOnderful recipe. I added onion (about half of one), chopped in the cuisinart along with the carrots and celery. Sauteed them in olive oil before adding to the peas. Sprinkled some pepper and garlic powder in and added maybe 1/2 cup of half and half towards the end. Soup needs to cook at least one hour to be thick enough but is really worth it! (Even my 1 yr old loved it!)
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;chef4six;5;Delicious, thisck and very filling soup! I doubled the recipe and freeze some. I sauted an onion and the carrots and celery in the pot before adding the stock. I also added a bay leaf and garlic powder and some thyme. I let it simmer for 2 1/2 - 3 hours to make sure the split peas got all mushy and made the soup thick.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;hilary;5;I LOVE this recipe! I have made it several times and it's always great. I've always had to leave it on the stove a little longer then the recipe says (2 1/2 - 3 hours) but it is well worth it! The reason some people may have found it watery is because they didn't let it simmer long enough. I usually add some rosemary, salt and pepper while it's simmering. My boyfriend loves this recipe and always requests me to make it! THANKYOU!!!
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;christine;4;I added garlic and onions but I loved this recipe. Thanks!
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;dayna;4;Good basic recipe, although it was definitely too watery. I added heavy cream and some onions and it turned out great.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;christinedh;4;I used the recipe, but opted to put a little bacon in it and it turned out great.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;hawn;4;A little watery for my personal taste. I followed the advise of another and added heavy cream and it was a little better.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;alana;3;This recipe was nice.
cbee2c44-4cd5-48e1-b7ab-52add1cec0a9;igarcia;3;I thought that this dish was missing something. It came out a lot more watery than I would have expected. I added heavy cream to give it density and make it more hearty. In the end it turned out good but I still would have liked it a little thicker like most other pea soups.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;whittakelli;4;"A very flavourful dish; however I did find a teaspoon of cayenne overpowered to an extent the more delicate spices like the ginger and cinnamon. Next time I make I will reduce the cayenne to 1/2 or 3/4 teaspoon. Also I will use ground cloves rather than whole cloves to more evenly distribute the spice throughout the dish. Simple changes for my tastebuds, but overall very good!"
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;claudial;5;Easy and so flavorful. I added fresh spinach until it wilted.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;dot;5;I halved the recipe, doubled the spices, and added 1 tsp. of salt. I then served it over plain rice. My son and I both loved it! The recipe is easy to make and very tasty!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;mardirb;3;Made the recipe as listed, except subbed chicken broth for bean water and thickened it with cornstarch. The heat level was ok, but it seriously needed base notes underneath the heat. Next time, I will try adding oregano, basil, thyme and marjoram, curry powder and garam masala
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;krazycook;5;Will definitely make again. Great protein side for vegetarians.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;mwhatiam;5;Omg, this was amazing. I made it as written, but had to used ginger powder in place of fresh. This was absolutely deliciousness! I added chicken, but I can see carrots and potatoes in this lovely sauce. Can’t wait to make this again!!! Run, don’t walk to make this!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;j2muw66;4;I made changes so am not sure how it’s supposed to turn out. I made the mistake of crushing the cloves and it overwhelmed the flavor.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jan;2;This does not have much flavor or spice
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;lisbeth;2;Even with the cayenne halved I could barely tolerate how hot this was. Maybe if you love super spicy food this will work for you. For me, the cayenne drowned out all the other spices.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;stephmcd;4;Excellent blend of spices! However, I’d use half the cayenne the next time I make this. I did add mushrooms and shredded carrots. And served it with rice noodles. Will definitely make this again
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;linda;5;Delicious! Instead of using the liquid in the cans of chickpeas, we substitute fresh water to minimize reactions to lectins (per a doctor's recommendation). Enjoy!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;lisa;5;I added chicken, mushrooms, green pepper, baby corn and zucchini. It was so spicy and delicious. Loved the garbanzo bean. Will make again.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;chris;5;Great easy to make recipe! I substituted ground cinnamon and ginger but still tasted great.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;donwilliams;5;Awesome dish
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;avidreader;5;Substituted ground ginger for the fresh ginger and ground cinnamon for the cinnamon sticks. Didn’t include the fresh cilantro. Tasty, will make again, particularly as I had frozen as two servings which when defrosted and warmed were as tasty as the freshly made servings.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;amy;4;Unless your vegetarian, I'm going to add chicken next time.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;bluewatersailor;3;I found it quite bland. If there is a next time, I would skip the cinnamon sticks and use ground instead. In order to salvage it, added a tablespoon of curry powder and salt. Then it was OK. Used fresh chickpeas That helped a lot. Still were able to taste the vegetables, which is great. I added carrots and zucchini to boost the nutritional value and add crunchiness.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ecooke;5;It is absolutely delicious. My family loved it. I cooked the dried chicken peas in the pressure cooker. I did not have cayenne pepper so I looked up substitutes: pepper flakes or paprika. I added a little of both. I agree, when using spices from the jar, it may seem bland. I tasted it and added more of the spices until I was satisfied with the taste.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;lisan;5;Delicious! Made as is - except used 1 tsp of ground cinnamon for the cinnamon sticks and no cayenne pepper. Will definitely be making again. The fresh cilantro made the flavors burst! Not a single chickpea left. As someone who has a TON of no-no foods due to health issues, this ROCKED! I served this on jasmine rice. Huge thanks!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;empressbarb;5;I used dried chick peas, soaked overnight, then boiled in a home made bone broth for an hour. It gives the chick peas a great texture. I halved the cayenne because I didn't want too much heat, but everything else I kept the same. I thought it was delicious.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;tomweihmayr;5;Super easy to make with ingredients that you most likely have at home. There is always a choice to add chicken, beef or pork to this dish for extra protein. However, I kept it veggie, added a side of brown mushrooms, and loved every bite!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;peter;5;We enjoyed this easy to make dinner. Could easily add chopped kale, chard or other leafy green into it while cooking then add the cilantro as a zesty topping. Also, since some like it hot AND sweet, pineapple bits could be added to give a totally different sensory sensation.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;valeriecottrill;4;It was great- we thought it could use a little sweetness so am planning to put raisins in next time.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;sncaraballo;5;Awesome!,,,,and very easy to cook!,,
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;pjonosm;5;This is one of my best curry recipes. Without using curry powder it still brings nice flavor and aroma. I used pumpkin and TVP in stead of chickpeas. For liquid, I used fish broth powder and water. Cinnamon is a must.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;carolyn;5;Loved it
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jt;5;I’ve made this several times - very flavourful and easy to make. Great vegetarian dish. I cut the amount of cayenne in half on most recent occasion as a bit spicy for my two girls with full teaspoon. I serve with mango chutney on the side - everyone loves it.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;nancy;4;Like the recipe.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;alecianewsome;5;This was a complete hit, i made a few tweaks subbing the cayanne pepper for red chili flakes and whole cumin versus ground and it was awesome. Do not skip on the Cilantro it made the flavors meld better. I ate this dish with rotis and mango chutney. Perfection!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;twinkletoes;3;It would have been delicious but I put too much ground cloves! The flavor was too strong. I added cottage cheese and tomato sauce to off-set my error. I'm sure it would have been delicious if it didn't have so much cinnamon flavor.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;haleypenk;4;Overall I thought this recipe was pretty good! My partner loved it, and it's a great option for if you're trying to cut back on meat a little like we are! I used a lot less onion than what was called for, and added half a bell pepper. I also used ground cinnamon instead of crushing up cinnamon sticks. I didn't follow a lot of reviewers' suggestion about omitting the chickpea water, and I wish I had. It was really thin and runny, although cornstarch thickened it slightly and the rice soaked it up. I might experiment with coconut milk next time.I would also suggest leaving out the ground coriander if you choose to mix in the cilantro- way too much coriander taste with both! Despite being overpowered at times by coriander, I thought the rest of the spices were balanced out nicely.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;nate;2;Was a little one note. Lots of heat.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;gabriellecollocott;5;It was so delicious!! Added in the spinach right before I served it and it was awesome! Added a few extra veggie ingredients but it was definitely a hit!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;kwiluvlucy2;5;Very easy and tasty. Made my own Tikka Masala
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;julie;3;The cloves whole is not a good idea because you bite into it and it tastes horrible. The Cayenne pepper they called for was too much for this dish it made it spicy. Well try to make it again but without cloves and cayenne peppers.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;charliecresswell;2;Found this pretty bland, i often cook curries and have a good source for fresh spices. A bit like eating just a tin of chickpeas. However i liked that it can be cooked as a very quick snack.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;meesh0806;5;Yes, I made this dish, but I did not follow the recipe exactly. Here are the modifications I made: 1. The recipe does not call for curry powder, so I added 1 tbsp of it. 2. The recipe calls for 2 onions. I would not recommend using 2 onions for only 2 cans of beans, it would be too much. I only used one onion and that was PLENTY. 3. I would never use the juice from canned food for anything. I drained the beans, rinsed them, and peeled the outer layer off before putting them in the pot to cook. Instead of using the can juice, I used 1 cup of vegetable broth. 4. I used 1 tbsp of ground cinnamon instead of 2 sticks. I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon. 5. I did not use cloves because the store didn't have them. With these modifications, the dish came out absolutely delicious!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;sarahbrinkman;5;LOVED IT!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;yakira;4;great , solid recipe. I am incredibly picky when it comes to indian food and flavorful food. Definitely would made again .
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;marykaychilton;5;This was great! I like a soupy Chickpea curry, so added a can of chopped tomatoes and I also like it spicy, so did heaping measurements of everything. Served over Basmati rice and it was perfect. I'm trying to have more meatless days, so this is satisfying and filling and healthy! I'm used to Indian meals taking hours or even days, so this is an awesome recipe for me. Made in after a long day at work at it was easy and delicious. Will be on regular rotation. Thank you!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;nadiaivannova;5;I make this dish often. It is quick and delicious and easy to modify spice levels depending on who I cook it for. I don't love using the water that the chickpeas have been sitting in so I actually rinse them and put a little plain water at the end and cover, which works well for me. I serve it over basmati rice or potatoes.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;cherrylekereiff;5;Oh my goodness...amazing meal! Will have again
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jackalinek;5;Super easy & super delicious! Full of flavour! Came out a little too spicy, maybe a tad bit too much cayenne pepper & I added curry powder. I also used canned chickpeas. For me finely chopping the onions was the most time consuming. Will definitely make it again!!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;robinwhitworth;5;Love how quick this is to put together. I followed some other reviews, but the versatility of this recipe allows for personal touches. I added broth to allow for a sauce. I did not add the cayenne for dietary reasons and the cinnamon because I was out of it. Who runs out of cinnamon!? It was still very tasty. I cant wait to try again with the cinnamon.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;daniellechisler;5;Quick and delicious! I did add a little more of each spice and I also subbed ground cinnamon for cinnamon sticks.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;janradford;5;I made this for my vegetarian teenage daughter & she loved it! I love that is is so high in protein which is something I worry that she doesn’t get enough of. The only change I made to the recipe was to add 8 ounces of canned tomatoes.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;kristiecarrnelson;3;It was ok. Edible, but not a favorite. Won't make again.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;kaitlynmartinez;3;I made it. It was spicy but it lacked flavor. But it was easy to make and filling. I'm probably not trying it again.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;womanrising;5;I loved it! It was one of the first recipes I made in my conversion to vegan way of life. Recipes like this makes it easy.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;summermom;1;You need to add a can of coconut milk or cream and squeeze lime on top when serving
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;islandgirl;4;With the exception of the cloves, I doubled the seasoning and added a can of fire roasted tomatoes. It was good, but it needed something to mellow it out or balance it. Like maybe some plain yogurt or cream? Any thoughts? It was great with rice and naan bread.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;janinetollot;1;didn't like it at all. I love curry (although I have been wondering where the curry in this recipe was), but I guess I am not a big fan of most of the other spices. ill keep it simple next time and just use curry, salt, ginger, garlic and onions
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ralph;5;This was excellent and so easy! Followed the recipe except I used ground cinnamon and clove. Going to try it again in the next day or so and add a bit of chicken/vegetable broth as we both felt it could use a bit more liquid (just a dash). Will try some of the other variations mentioned in the future.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;sandrameraz;4;"I'm guessing this is really good if you're used to the amount of chili powder; my daughter did but I felt it was really hot, lol"
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;mimi;1;Too bland. Had to doctor it up
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ranjinipillai;5;More chili powder (Kashmiri chili) and using dry chickpeas after overnight soaking!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;uzuri224;5;I’ll definitely be making this again!!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;norbert;5;Tastes great, and has good flavours. Personally, i like my curries quite hot and this wasn’t. But of course once everything’s mixed, it’s easy enough to taste test and add more cayenne if you wish. Just a note for spicy heat lovers.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;hildamae;5;Spicy and delicious. Wonderful with a little yogurt on the side and warm naan.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;neo7754;5;It was very tasty and refreshing. The curry taste was not over powering. Can be made for non curry fans. Will make again soon.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jessicawaitebrecheisen;5;Delish! Super quick & easy...family’s new favorite
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;melanie;5;Absolutely delicious! I did add can stewed tomatoes which was even better. This was my first Indian dish that I attempted and it was perfection. Thank you for the direction !
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;charliecam;5;I've never made a curry dish before and this one was very forgiving. I was also coming down with a cold and this helped open my sinuses...unexpected and most welcome side effect!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;karol;2;I love curry. I followed the recipe to the letter. I thought it was awful. Just couldn't do it.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;pokygirl;4;My husband liked this. He said though when he thinks if curry he thinks ’saucy’ and it wasn’t hit enough (I went light on the cayenne, didn’t know where to stop!) he did like it though and he’s not a big fan of chick peas. I thought it was pretty good. Maybe I’ll try some tomato purée or some coconut milk next time to Sauce it up?
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;meganp;4;"I have made this twice now. The first time it was not very curry like; I used too much of the “sweet” spices. This time it was spicier and I liked it much better. I didn’t use cinnamon sticks or fresh ginger either time; instead I used the dried version of each. Both times I dumped all the liquid out of the cans bc I didn’t read the directions through. So I used 1.5 cups of chicken broth. I will continue to make this recipe !"
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;robin;5;This turned out sooo delicious! I added some coconut milk and a little sugar too. I will definitely save this recipe and make it again!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;debbie;4;Quick, easy and delicious. Thanks.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;april;2;I husband wouldn’t eat it.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jah;5;Quick and easy for this busy mom. I’m always on the lookout for healthy recipes that take less than an hour. I’ll be adding this to my rolodex. My husband loves coming home to the smell of food and as soon as he walked in he said “something smells great”.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;hoopskirt;5;Used cannellini beans when I discovered I didn't have chickpeas. Also didn't have cilantro, so added a lot of finely chopped fresh spinach. The flavor was very good.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;lorit;4;A bit too spicy for my family, but otherwise fantastic. Very aromatic and pleasing to the eye. Next time I will reduce the cayenne pepper. by at least half and maybe add paneer for some protein. I added a dollop of greek yogurt on top to cool the heat a bit. Also, as I did not have whole cloves, I used about 1/4 tsp ground and substituted about 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon in place of the cinnamon sticks.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;francesmoses;5;It is so good i will be making it again.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ifortuna;5;Fine recipe. If you have it or can get it, add a little asafoetida . It smells terrible but it will make your Indian dishes more Indian and the scent goes away when cooked with your other ingredients. I love chick peas.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;tammylynn;5;My husband loved this! I made just as written, except instead of cinnamon sticks, I used a few dashes of cinnamon. I'll make this again.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;karnjoshi;4;its really simple and really easy.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;acanthoplax;5;Spicy!! I like it!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;talena;4;I made this as directed and thought it was really good. I will double the amount of spices next time. Don't forget to add the cilantro. I served the dish without and realized that I forgot it half way through dinner. It really changed the flavor and made it so much better.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;christinewootton;4;"Nice recipe but a bit bland for a curry. Id make it ahain; but would double or even triple the hotter spices."
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;kristinann;3;I used ground ginger, cloves, and cinnamon as other reviewers recommended. I also drained the chickpeas and added some water. My spices were all fresh from the store, too. After tasting and finding it bland, I added some smoked salt and chicken bouillon. I would have added fish sauce, too, if I could find mine- it’s disappointingly lacking in umami.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jackawesome;5;This curry recipe was fantastic. The curry powder I used was an Indian mix that I purchased in a huge bottle from our local Chinese specialty market. This turned out very creamy.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;nancyo;5;I will make this again and add other items like other cooks did. It was Delicious. I served it on Toppables Crackers with Laughing Cow Cream Cheese as an appetizer before Thanksgiving dinner and it was a big hit! Didn't use cilantro
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;babedan;4;I made it in the slow cooker after soaking the beans overnight....next time I will add less water...but was very tasty!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;morgantalbot;5;Super yummy! I added cauliflower and peas to it and it was jusssst perfect! Definitely making this again!!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;moosetracks;4;I thought this was delicious but way too much cayenne pepper.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;meinalem;5;Very spicy, but still good!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;rtrottier;5;This recipe surprised me. I left out the cinnamon but the cloves were such a surprising flavour. It's not too dry as is, but you can add tomatoes to it to give it more substance if you wish.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;yraldoerodriguez;5;Great recipe! ! What a way to start my vegan diet!! Thanks! !
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;sean;5;Very tasty curry base. I used vegetable broth in place of the chick pea juice. Cut the cayenne pepper in half and it still had some heat. Used only one can of chick peas but added equivalent volume of stir-fried cauliflower then ~1/4 cup frozen peas at the end to add colour. Served with yogurt {forgot to get naan bread}. Excellent for lunch the next day too.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;grace;2;I ate this and almost died of spicyness. 1 teaspoon of ceyenne pepper was wwwwwaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyy to much
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jules;5;I made this recipe as written. my wife and I loved it. it was very easy and tasty. we will most definitely make again.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;mila;5;It was great! Will cook it again for sure
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;wvllfleur;5;I am what one can say a lazy vegan and all I can say is that not only was this dish simple and quick, it was delicious. I am not a professional in the kitchen, but being new to veganism has given me the opportunity to find treasure recipes such as this one...it's rich and all the spices went perfectly together. I added peas to the mix for some color and it was a good choice. One thing I did differently was to use 1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon rather than what the recipe called for. I felt like a was at one of my favorite Indian restaurants. 5 stars for sure!!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;bethcoronejo;5;Delicious and so easy to make!!! I love it!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;cowgirll;5;Huge stunning flavor. This one is amazing, just make sure your spices are super fresh!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;lisab;5;Soooo good! Very spicy! I used ground cinnamon and cloves and as one reviewer suggested added a can of diced tomatoes. I will definitely make this again. Loved it!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;rendel;4;Way to much cayenne... It was on the edge for me and the kids couldn't handle it at all.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;kamilrozanski;4;Turned out pretty good, served it over rice. Definitely on the super mild side of Indian food, but if you tinker around with the spices then you can fine tune it to the taste you prefer. I ended up adding 1.5x the ginger, cloves, and coriander, and doubled the amount of pepper and cumin. Added a tablespoon of corn starch to help thicken the sauce a bit, and skipped out on the cilantro entirely (my roommate and I are both part of the genetic subgroup that just thinks it tastes like soap). Overall, I'll definitely make it again, it was quick, easy, and tasty.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jonathanm;5;Very tasty! Spice level was good. A great meal or snack. With whole wheat pita or wrap sliced and toasted, was an excellent and healthy meal. Excellent.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;mozellejacobs;4;Made this one and loved it! Added zucchini to it and went lighter on the cayenne (probably half of what was called for). I paired it with a red/wild rice and quinoa. Yummy!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;amocarty;4;Will be making this again, loved it, quick, easy to make and a good hearty dish for miserable cold evenings! Added a little low fat natural yogurt and wondered about the addition of raisins to sweeten the dish a little, might try that the next time!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;shea;5;This is really good! I didn't use fresh ginger, used jarred one instead, but it was still really good. Thanks!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;anataliba;5;Easy and quick. I added diced tomatoes for extra flavor and texture. Next time I would reduce the cinnamon by half, it was a bit overwhelming.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;angaval3;5;I made this today and I must say its AMAZING! so flavorful and very filling on this cold day!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;richardfrank;5;Flavor was totally amazing. Been looking for a way to make chick peas that I can really get behind. As I'm trying to lean towards vegetarian cuisine, and this was a last minute attempt. I added steam carrots as a side. The flavor combination was really surprisingly cohesive. I'd implore you to try it.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;tommyfloyd;4;It was good. If you have extra broth it's nice to add more broth and then cook down for a better flavor
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;sapete15;5;This is one of my favorite recipes of all time, and I have been making it for years for my family. Sometimes, though, the spice as written can be a bit too hot for younger members of my family, so a tablespoon of mild curry blend actually was a better fit for my family than the turmeric, cumin, and coriander. All other spices I kept exactly the same. I would wager that those who argue that this is not flavorful enough are being impatient and throwing everything into the pot at once. Dishes like this need to have the flavored layered. Don't skip steps. Also, cilantro takes on a bitter flavor when heated. I wouldn't add it to the pot at all. Finally, in our house, this is a complete meal served over jasmine rice and topped with cilantro and a dollop of yogurt.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;lauradraganov;5;One of my favorite go-to meals! Easy, quick and delicious
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;michaelnicely;3;I thought this was great! Cheap and easy dinner.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;callmealice;4;2015.07.12 - Per other reviewers: 6 whole cloves = 1/2 tsp ground clove, 1 inch cinnamon stick = 1 tsp ground cinnamon, added one can undrained diced tomatoes to 1/2 recipe and drain (homecooked) chickpeas, crushed 1/4 to 1/3 of the chickpeas with a spoon as they cooked. Left out the cilantro for DBF's sake. Served with turmeric rice (1.5 cups rice sauteed on medium in 1 Tbs butter for two minutes, add 3/4 tsp turmeric & 1/2 tsp salt, add 3 cups water and simmer approx. 10 minutes (still medium)). This was okay, but it was a little bland with a good aftertaste. (No, my spices aren't old.) Maybe double spices next time and accumulate them in a small bowl as the onions cook. 2015.02.29 - Doubled all dry spices except cayenne (used 1/2 tsp cayenne). Used 1 tsp salt. Used butter instead of oil. Added one can diced tomatoes with juices. Cooked in ceramic skillet. Still no cilantro for DBF.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;joannenozick;3;It was too spicy for my tastes, and not enough sauce. I used chicken broth instead of the liquid from the chickpeas, added some cooked chicken and some canned diced tomatoes, which added to the sauce. Not bad to work with, will tone down some of the spice perhaps.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;lisacurths;4;This is so good! I did add chicken with the onions and served it over rice. I ended up using home cooked Garbanzo beans. Be sure to add the liquid you cooked them in so the dish isn't dry. Otherwise, I didn't change anything. I will be adding this quick yummy meal to my weeknight repertoire!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;sheela;4;I am Indian and this tastes great. Once I did not have ginger and left it out and still tasted very good. Often I leave out the cinnamon as well. As a variation, I have added a diced up tomato for color but be careful because it can make it too thin. As another variation, I have added about 1 and 1/2 cups raw cauliflower after the chick peas (having added a little extra 1/2tsp cumin, coriander, turmeric and chili) and let it cook in the liquid - my picky (Indian) dad loved it.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;michele;5;We really enjoyed this! I used 2 tsp of garlic ginger paste and a little bit of dried, minced garlic. I also substituted ground spices for the cinnamon and clove. I rinsed the two cans of chickpeas and added a whole can of diced tomatoes! Honestly, this recipe can call for two cans. We added one large chopped potato. Also, I threw everything into a slow cooker and came home to a beautiful aroma. Next time I think I'll add cauliflower and green peas.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;cmm5634;5;The was awesome!! We added more spices, and chicken. It was so good and do spicy!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ebonycarter;4;My family and I loved this recipe. Substituted ground cinnamon and doubled the seasoning measurements for some extra pow! Will try adding potatoes next time, too.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;josephdowdy;4;Very quick & easy recipe. If you have a stocked spice rack already then this one probably won't cost you more than $10 and it'll last for four-five meals :) Highly recommend, I liked the slight kick it had too.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;bibilit;5;Gave this recipe a try last night, and I am very pleased. I made it for my mother. I drained most of the canned chick peas liquid. From both cans total, I'd say that I only used about 1 cup of liquid. I did this to cut back on sodium. I also used 1- 1 1/2 tablespoons of curry instead of turmeric. I used one dash of cayenne pepper. And I also added fresh cherry tomatoes into this dish. And I didn't use an coriander or salt. Recipe was good :)
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;molly;2;I did not care for this recipe.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ndalum2002;5;This was great! I used canned chick peas and included the water from the can in the recipe. I may use veggie or chicken broth next time. Used 1 teaspoon of cinnamon as I did not have the sticks. Cut the cloves down to 4 as I don't really like them and cut the cayenne pepper to 1/2 teaspoon because I'm a wimp. I didn't use quite as much cilantro and used dried as that was all I had on hand. The flavor that resulted was wonderful meld of a sweet cinnamon start with a peppery bite at the end. My husband, who specifically hates chick peas, was savoring these one by one. I served it with the Curry Stand Chicken Tikka Masala and chipotle lime rice here on the site. Possibly the best dinner that I have ever made.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;mjccooks;3;This is a a easy, quick recipe but I found it to be on the bland side. I'm used to Indian food so maybe I just need more spices in my food - that is a very individual aspect.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;tabithakirklandturowski;5;"This made my house smell AMAZING. Modifications: drained the chickpeas, doubled the spices (used 2 tsp ground cinnamon instead of sticks) except the cayenne pepper, which I reduced to 1/2 tsp, and reduced the cilantro to ~1/2 cup. Additions: 1 (14.5 oz) can of diced tomatoes, a handful each of kale, frozen peas, and cauliflower, and a diced boiled potato (added in the last few minutes). I simmered everything together for about 40 minutes and periodically added splashes of chicken broth to prevent things from getting too dry. I used a wide saucepan (kind of like a half-stockpot); a frying pan would not be tall enough to contain all the ingredients."
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ritapalazziyee;5;I made this recipe with a few differences due to what I had on hand. I soaked a pound of dried chickpeas in water overnight, then cooked in water on low in the crockpot the next day while at work. I drained most of the water off them, then followed the recipe except I didn't have stick cinnamon or whole cloves. I used the following conversions: 1 tsp ground cinnamon for each stick 1/2 tsp ground cloves = 6 whole Given that I used a whole pound of chickpeas, I doubled all spices. I did omit the cayenne and used a slight sprinkling of some ground red pepper (which may be the same a cayenne, but it's old so not as hot lol) I also added one can of petite diced tomatoes in juice. This is one of the most amazing recipes I've ever used. The smell and taste is amazing!!!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;kitchenkitty;4;I liked this recipe, but did make a couple of changes. I used white kidney beans when I realized I didn't have any chickpeas. I found it a bit too spicy for the kids so I added half a can of coconut milk and a cup of peas.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ginny60;5;My husband first made this a few months back and now we have it almost once a week! It's super easy once you have all the spices on hand. I do add a can of undrained tomatoes to make it saucier.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;karenhicks;5;So good. We love Indian food. This is so easy and not complicated. Good for a quickie dinner.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jennifer;5;A huge hit with us! My husband and I loved it. The only change I made was I substituted whole cloves and cinnamon with their ground counterparts. I also added 8 oz of tomato sauce just to give it another layer. I might add potatoes next time. Delicious!!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;thedavidcreed;5;simple but morish!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;cristinagomezbacor;4;My husband and I really liked this dish. We have a few suggestions: grind all your spices in a coffee bean grinder before adding them. This way you're not having to pick through pieces of cinnamon or biting into a whole clove. Also, I would cut the cayenne by 2/3 - our dish was so spicy! Skip the fresh cilantro, I did.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;nashikta;5;This is a great curry. I added an extra teaspoon of cayenne pepper since we love spicy food. I also added 2t of Greek double yoghurt. Some ground channa thickens the curry.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;kttrondsen;4;Great easy recipe! I added stewed tomatoes to my mix as I felt it really was missing that something extra. I also ground my cloves instead of putting them in whole and used ground cinnamon instead of the sticks.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;latonyamimms;4;Very flavorful l, however I would ex the whole cloves and use ground cloves, as they can be unpleasant to bite into.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;elisabet;3;I added extra spices and it didn't turn out right. I added spinach to add some greens. Will try again with vegetable stock and more vegetables.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ihaveserioustastebuds;5;I was looking for something simple, tasty, cheap, and would last me a good amount of time (I'm a left over person). I read way too many reviews but bunched together what i thought were the best and created something fantastic. I doubled the coriander and cumin and used a little less than 2 tsp ground cinnamon instead of sticks. I also added 1 tsp chaat masala and a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes (with sauce) with the garbanzo beans. I threw in potatoe flakes at the end to thicken the sauce. Put it on top of my curry rice recipe. Wonderful.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;squirrelgirl22;3;Nice and easy to make. Definitely a little hot/spicy, but a solid meal.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;bspalin7;5;This recipe is great. The spices for the curry flavor can be used on a variety of other foods and vegetables as well. Generally speaking, I only use about half of the turmeric. Otherwise, it has too much of that chalky taste. Also, feel free to add other vegetables when you add the chickpeas. Chopped fresh green beans works well. You might want to add 1/4 cup chicken broth to give it more liquid if you do.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;homerisking;5;Delicious!! I’m new to cooking with curry. This is my 4th or 5th recipe. All the others called for curry powder as opposed to adding all the ingredients separately like this one. What a difference!! This had way more flavor. This is my favorite curry recipe so far!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;mouse;1;I am definitely going to make it again, but this time, I'm going to rehydrate garbanzo beans, instead of using canned. Somehow, this didn't taste like much and had to add more spice. I'm not counting this recipe out, but if I find it didn't taste any better with fresh chickpeas, I'm done with this recipe!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;cindyr;3;Good, but I thought there were too many different spices in it.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jenbug;2;It turned out beautiful looking with the perfect liquid consistency. But, the red pepper was completely overpowering. I used some sour cream to tone down the heat and ate it with Naan bread. I also agree that there is something missing. I will probably try it again using a different recipe.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;k;5;Thank you! Started from dried and made a delicious Wednesday evening dinner. We will eat this again.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;arvinpeter;4;Very nice! I added a half diced tomato to it and garnished with cilantro. Just like my ma used to make!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;theknittingjedi;5;This was my first go at making an Indian dish and I was not disappointed. As per other reviews, I drained the canned chickpeas and subbed in a can of diced tomatoes, and I threw in a couple handfuls of baby spinach. I also used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon as opposed to crushing sticks. Next time I may use ground cloves instead of whole. I picked out all but one before I served it (I found the last one in my bowl halfway through eating it). Since other reviewers commented on the level of spiciness, I cut the cayenne pepper in half just to be safe. I asked my husband afterwards what he thought and he said that next time I should use the full amount. We both enjoy spicy food, so it may not be for everyone. I served the curry over basmati rice (I also found that recipe on this site) and it was delicious! My husband is a picky eater and he really enjoyed it, and he even got to the leftovers before I did!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;anne;4;Delicious!! Added 1 tablespoon of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of sour cream as added too much cayenne and wow! It is even more to my taste. :)
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;nok;5;Finally I found the chickpea curry recipe I've been looking for. This is not spicy like some other recipes I've found on-line. Definitely a keeper!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;amandabrewster;5;Great flavor!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;inapickle;4;I give this 4 stars with the addition of fresh chopped tomatoes. The liquid from the tomatoes also helps the chickpeas cook longer and stay moist. Doesn't even really need the fresh cilantro. The broken up cinnamon stick is spicy! I also like the addition of the whole clove. I used ginger powder because I didn't have the fresh ginger but will use it next time. I added some mild green chilies from my garden although it doesn't really need it, with the cayenne pepper giving it heat.Thanks, a good curry base I can use with other things. I like to eat Indian-style chickpeas with store-bought tandoori naan that I heat up on my gas stove using the open flame and tongs, then spread with butter. Trader Joe's has a decent naan,and even our Safeway imports a decent one. Our best naan-type bread is homemade (secret recipe) from our nearby Lebanese restaurant! They call it pita but it tastes like naan.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;faithirene;4;I wanted to make this a meal so I added fresh spinach, tomatoes and prawns. My husband loved it, but it was way too spicy for me!! The flavor was really delicious, I just couldn't eat it. I made rice to eat it with left overs and that helped some with the heat. I didn't notice any other comments about it being too hot, so maybe I did something differently and didn't notice. Will try again with tweaking to reduce the heat.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;lizziej78;5;My go-to chickpea curry recipe- delicious, simple, fast.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;nickdiorio;5;I'm not normally into vegetarian type dishes, but this was deliciously flavorful and easy to make.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;chrianna;5;this was so good! i omitted the cayenne because my family doesn't like spice. also followed other recommendations and used ground cinnamon and ground cloves. i put it over quinoa and it was very filling. the next day leftovers tasted even better~
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;awarden;4;This was my first curry ever and it was delicious. Super easy recipe.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ljinthepeg;5;The flavour combination was great. I reduced the cayenne after reading reviews - glad I did. This is a great dish - thanks for the great recipe.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;cocoapowder;1;Unfortunately I am really not a fan of this one...it is so dry! I kept looking back at the recipe thinking I missed an ingredient or something but no. I will not be remaking this.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;khbryan;2;Smelled delicious but was too spicy to eat
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;pm99;5;yummm.... i first boiled my chick peas for 20 min to get them nice and tender. my wife on the other hand like the butter chicken sause from a can... : ( what does she know anyway!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;aisingularity;5;Tasty vegetarian dish!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;la3er;4;Good recipe! It was a little spicy by itself, but was excellent with some brown rice. I even added some Thompson raisins, was perfect combination. Great meal and healthy too!!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;eeknitit;5;Great recipe. I followed the advice of others. I added 1/2 tsp of both ginger and cloves and 1 tsp. of cinnamon. I added only a dash of cayenne pepper and omitted the cilantro. After adding the beans (drained), I poured in some chicken broth to cook and soften the beans. I simmered it all for about 15 minutes. We heated a few slices of naan bread on the grill and dipped it in the curry. A really good meal.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;babymaster;5;truly magical! absolutely loved the crushed cinnamon in this dish, the fragrance of the cloves and then the cilantro, the ginger and how all of the other components of this dish worked so well together! me n my honey were definitely whisked away! lol thnk u :)
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jjordan321;4;This was a very tasty base recipe for a chickpea curry. I wish I would have read these reviews first so that I would have omited the crushed cinnamon sticks. Im not a big cook but either I didnt crush them enough or that was just a bad suggestion. I keep picking tough pieces of the cinnamon out of it as I eat it. Besides that this is super yummy! I will try it again and next time will not be using the cinnamon sticks.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jwilke;4;This was very tasty and super easy. I didn't have the coriander, so I skipped that. Substituted ground cloves and cinnamon with no issue. I cut down the cayenne a bit, and it was still quite spicy.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;christinesacchettiglazar;3;As much as we like spicy food, one teaspoon of cayenne pepper was too much for this recipe. It overpowered the other spices. I would make it again by using 1/2 tsp.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ok48;5;Easy and good. I soaked 2 c. dried chickpeas with water to cover for 5 hours, drained them, then pressure cooked them with 4 more cups of water for 45 minutes. I will reduce the cayenne next time for my grandbabies and let my husband add Tabasco to his liking.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;katharyn;5;I really love this recipe. I leave out the cilantro and add all the other spices powdered. Today I used allspice instead of coriander, and accidently used a sweet onion. It was really good. With a food processor to chop the onion, and canned chickpeas, it's easier than pasta! (I also serve over rice.)
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;makacska;5;This is just excellent, my family and I love it. I do leave out the cayenne pepper, as I’m not a big fan of spicy food. One piece of advice: In the unlikely event that you have leftovers, remove the cinnamon sticks before refrigerating, as they will completely overpower every other flavor by the next day.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;kismetliz;5;This was awesome! I made it pretty much as is... I omitted the ground coriander and cilantro, as I don't like the taste. Also, I used about 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon as I didn't have a stick. With the chickpeas, you can also drain them and add the liquid as needed to control your consistency. It has some kick with the cayenne pepper and my husband, who was reluctant, loved it.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;joybelles;4;Very good and simple to make but SPICY! Next time I will halve the cayenne. It's deceiving though... it doesn't smell spicy while cooking. My youngest doesn't like spicy food but ate it well by adding a spoonful of sour cream. I mixed my leftovers well with rice and that helped the next day (either didn't have enough rice with it the night before or didn't mix it well enough). Loved the flavor and ease of preparation. Will probably make it again since I have enough of bulk purchased seasoning left over.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;thestrokes14;5;Sooo good. Recommendations: You can omit the coriander (its basically cilantro, assuming you DO have cilantro). I also recommend adding a can of diced tomatoes (with juice) rather than the garbanzo bean can water. Also, eat over rice (even a little is worth it). Instead of using cayenne pepper, a few dashes of hot sauce works really well without making it too spicy. Also lime juice adds a nice kick. I'll be making this many more times!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;sueb;5;I cooked up chickpeas and mung beans to use as the beans, then I used 1/4 tsp. ground cloves and 1 tsp. ground cinnamon instead of the whole spices, and cut the amount of cayenne pepper down. After all that, I found that I didn't have cilantro! But, the taste was OK!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;abigregorio;5;This is so simple and outstanding. I added two roma tomatoes from our garden chopped up. Used three cans of chickpeas. Doubled all the spices except the cayenne (1/4tspn). I've made it three days in a row! It's that good. Would be great with spinach, cooked potatoes or paneer too!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;turbotastic;4;Plain without the curry powder. So use a dash of it. Cut down the cinnamon & cloves (not a fan).
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;metatwaddle;4;"This dish was very tasty and pretty easy, even for someone like me who had never made curry before. However, I didn't get it perfect the first time. I didn't taste any clove flavor, except when I accidentally bit into one. (I'll use ground cloves next time.) I thought the cilantro was a little too strong, although nobody else seemed to mind. And I left out the chickpea ""juice"" per a suggestion here, but that made it too dry and not saucy enough, so I had to add water. Other substitutions worked quite well: instead of 1 tsp of cayenne, I used 1/2 tsp of chili paste, which was enough heat for me, but a fire-breathing pepper fiend might want a full teaspoon. I substituted 1 & 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon for the cinnamon sticks. I also added a bunch of ground black pepper to enhance the flavor, a modification I strongly recommend."
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;emily082;4;Just finished making this! I didn't know one of my favorite foods would be so easy to make! I found it a bit too spicy for my taste, but I just mixed in some sour cream and was fine. I will be mixing all the spices together and placing in a small spice jar for ease of making next time
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;thedibleincredible;4;"Definitely need to double the spices in this dish. I used powdered ginger instead of fresh and cardamom as well, cut the cayenne pepper way down and added green peppers and fresh mushrooms. Made this one a ton of times; it's quick, it's easy, it's versatile, and it's nutritious!"
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;nursenikki2004;5;I only had a bite of this, was instantly hooked, and made sure to have my friend send me the recipe. I will definitely be passing this one along to my brother too since he doesn't like to eat any meats other than seafood and is crazy about Indian spices.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;johndraj;5;Found this recipe easy to make... It does need a bit of chilli powder. A more realistic number of servings is about 6. My grad school room mates enjoyed it!!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;sierra;4;Whoa. This recipe sounded great to me, but I was a little worried about the entire teaspoon of cayenne I was told to put in. I was going to just cut it to half, but after reading through the other reviews and essentially feeling like I was being called a chicken if I didn't put all the spice in, I decided to show them what's what. Ouch. Maybe it's that my cayenne came fresh right from the organics department, so it had some zing to it, but I ended up adding an extra 15oz of garbanzos to try and soak up the spice. No luck. I'm still hurtin'. So if you've got quality ingredients, and a fainter heart than a Bengal Tiger, you might want to ease off the cayenne just a tad. Otherwise, great!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;razbarey;4;I guess its not right to rate this recipe, because I made a few changes, but I used it as a base. I didn't have cloves or cilantro, but I added some curry powder, and potatoes, zucchini, and what really made it for me, was the addition of some fresh squeezed lime juice. It was delicious. And because I was sharing with my 9 month old baby girl I left out the cayenne. We both LOVED it. next time i will add cauliflower
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;mjc443;5;awesome!!! :)
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;corilita;4;I liked it. I served it with potatoes which is a mistake since the chickpea has the same consistency as potato. They just soaked all the flavor up. So next time I'll serve with rice.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;nmsnyder;4;This dish was quite yummy. I didn't have the turmeric but used 1/2 a teaspoon of curry powder instead. Perfect!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;lauren;3;The flavor was good but way too spicy!! I'll use less cayenne pepper next time.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;paul;5;I just tried this recipe and loved the flavour, I followed the recipe exactly except scaled back for 4. I'd make it again in a heart beat. Thanks, Paul
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;1sassycook;4;Wow! This is delicious!! I made this as an easy lunch and had all the ingredients on hand. I added a bit of garam masala, halved the cayenne and added a diced potato to the onions as they sauteed. I also added some spinach and halved cherry tomatoes at the end. Will definitely make again. Thanks for posting!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;christyw;5;This is by far one of my favourite recipes of all time! After the first time I made it I wondered how I spent so much money on Indian take-out! The only changes I make are to leave out the cilantro and to add 1/2 can diced tomatos. We have this regularly now and the ingredients are a staple in our house!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;maryammitchell;5;Great recipe. we do 'meatless Mondays' and this is perfect! Note: for those in the US (we live abroad) they do sell dry/fresh chickpeas in some parts of the world, so the recipe poster is probably drawing from her own experience.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;vmachak;5;Simple, easy, and delicious. Subbed ground cinnamon and coriander seeds, because that's what we had. Also, I cook dried beans, so I added the equivalent of two cans and some water. Served with plain yogurt and whole wheat pita. Thanks!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;dwaj1988;5;This is so good. I have been trying to find a recipe that tastes like the food prepared for me by my friend from India and this is it.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;biscuits;5;I like this recipe. I am a big indian food lover. So I fix this every chance I get. I add tomatoes and serve this over brown rice. I also, add some chicken broth to the dish to give it some liquid content, so that it is not so dry.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;767;4;Yum! My sister is a vegetarian and doesn't cook, so if she ever wants something home-made.. she comes to my home. We all liked this, even us meatier types... I did take the advice others gave though, and added tomatoes and their juice instead of the canned garbanzo liquid.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jjketark;4;I couldn't believe all my kids ate it! I thought it was pretty good, too.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jprett77;2;After all the positive reviews, I was very disappointed in this. The dish had heat but very little flavour. In the end I had to add extra garlic and ginger, a tin of tomatoes, a couple of cardamoms, black pepper and a couple of spoonsful of tikka masala paste I had in the store cupboard for it to be edible.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;terpgirl;5;Delicious!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;carleyi;1;I have brand new spices and this recipe didn't turn out well at all. I just wasted two cans of garbanzo beans. Ugh.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jules;4;This was pretty good, but it could just be because I'm really hungry? I used 1 tsp. of cinnamon in place of the cinnamon sticks. I didn't find this to be bland like others did, so like another reviewer suggested, maybe your spices are just really old. The cayenne added a nice kick. I used 1 small onion, 2 would be too many. I found that even though I cooked this a little longer than the recipe indicated, I still had crunchy bits. I think I'll throw in the ginger with the onion to make sure it gets cooked and then I'll let the whole thing simmer covered for 20 minutes or so to soften it. Also, I liked another reviewer's suggestion to mash up some of the beans to add thickness. Overall, good and would make again.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;karli;2;too spicy, not sure what people were talking about when they said there isn't any spice... kinda boring as well. And too much cilantro for my taste
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;foodie123;4;"This came out quite well. I added a can of diced tomatoes and doubled the ginger, cumin, coriander, and turmeric. I also threw in a little curry powder I had. I also added a diced baked potato with the chick peas. It ended up being a bit dry, but adding some water worked just fine. It also ended up being a tad bit spicy with just the rice but combining with some plain yogurt from the supermarket works really well. Also, for reference: 2 tsp fresh ginger root = 1 tsp ground ginger; 6 whole cloves = 1/2 tsp ground clove, 1 inch cinnamon stick = 1 tsp ground cinnamon"
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;vanessajbaca;4;This came out delicious, but I made substantial changes so I'm giving it 4 stars. I used garlic oil, 1 red onion and three tablespoons of minced garlic. I used dried ginger, dried cinnamon, turmeric and dried cumin - and I doubled the spices. Sauteed together for about 5 mins, then added 1 can of garbanzo beans and 1 can of diced tomatoes, both in their juices. I added a small can of coconut milk (for creaminess), a dash of fish sauce, some vegetable broth and vegetable bouillon, and fresh chopped cilantro and simmered for 30 mins. Oh yes, and I added a dollop of red curry paste I had left over, as I had no garam masala. It is an excellent base for many different types of curries. I was very pleased. Thank you!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;mrshinman;5;Added extra can of chickpeas, drained and rinsed them, and added vegetable broth for moisture. Yum!!!! A new favorite of mine!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;dripdotswirl;4;pretty good. im not sure how many times i will use those spices again tho. my family doesn't eat curry too much and most of those spice are used for curry.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ritakay8;3;I would rate this as good. Had very good flavor! I didn't crush the cinnamon, but just broke up and took out the pieces when we ate it. Were we suppose to eat the cinnamon sticks?
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;junie;5;Easy, tasty, and will make again. Followed the advice of others and used ground cinnamon. I omitted the ground coriander salt as I did not have it, and decreased the amount of cayenne pepper. Next time I probably will add spinach. Planned to take some for lunch, however my family ate it all.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;applegrace;1;I was excited to try this recipe as I love chickpeas and all curry dishes. Unfortunately, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out way too spicy! I would suggest only used 1/3 or less of a teaspoon of cayenne and then taste it before adding more. I wanted to throw the batch out after having one serving.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;hazey;4;Nice healthy recipe to get chickpeas in your diet. Thanks for uploading. Changes I made: As suggested by others, added a tin of chopped tomatoes and a handful of spinach. Also added some sultanas (may try honey next time) since the dish to me seemed to be lacking sweetness. Served with some toasted pita bread.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;cookinmom;5;Awesome recipe. Thanks for the suggestion to add a can of diced tomatoes. Would also recommend doubling the spices. Enjoy you won't be disappoined.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;kelli;5;This is such an easy, cheap and fast recipe. We ate it with rice and salad, and it was delicious! I also like to make extra, keep in refrigerator, and then serve in a tortilla as a wrap. Wonderful! Thank you for this recipe!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;foodchannellover;5;delicious!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;janet;5;"I have loved this recipe for years... This version, using individual spices, is the best. I rely on a jarred curry powder like McCormick's - but it is still delicious. The only thing I would add is a diced green bell pepper; I fry it up with the garlic and curry powder."
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;chris;5;Awesome dish! It's a quick supper and it's healthy!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ruth;4;The recipe was good as a base, but was fabulous with a few tweaks. I added a can of coconut milk, a handful of raisins, 2 tsp tamarind pulp, a couple handfuls of spinach, about 1 cup of diced tomatoes, and didn't have cilantro so I omitted that. It was perfect! One of my favourite recipes!!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;cassidytonkin;5;Quick, healthy and tasty! Thanks!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;angelina;3;decent i guess. a dry curry- not a liquid chickpea curry like i have had at restaurants. be aware it's quite spicy. i added only 1/4 tsp cayenne. used 1 tsp ground cinn & 1/4 tsp ground cloves. added a can of diced tomatoes as suggested by other reviewers. it was definitely edible, but not as good as I had hoped. this recipe has gotten such rave reviews. i was disappointed. this is a good base recipe but not quite what i was looking for i guess.. thanks anyway.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;meanderingfox;5;Tasty.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;karina;5;This came out really well. I modified a few things based on the suggestions from the reviews such as adding tomatoes, adding some curry powder, and using half the cayenne (it was still spicy, but much more tolerable for my taste). I let it simmer for about 20 minutes so the chickpeas would be really tender and the liquid could reduce and thicken a bit and then I thickened it a little bit further using a cornstarch slurry so the sauce wouldn't be so watery. As a few others suggested, I prepared the chickpeas tonight to be served tomorrow. If it's yummy today, it will be awesome tomorrow. If you like exotic spices and flavors, then you should definitely give this a try.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;smitty3l;5;I make this close to once a week and it's easily my favorite dinner. I use 1 tsp ground cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of ground cloves as other reviewers had mentioned. I usually leave out the cayenne for my 4 year old and will add it at the end on my plate only. Also add a can of diced tomatoes. I keep some ginger in my freezer just for this recipe. It's pretty cheap and keeps forever in the freezer. Thanks to Alton Brown for that tip. This is absolutely delicious!!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jenniferjuniper;5;Delicious. I doubled this recipe, maybe added a little extra cilantro, and added ground cinnamon and cloves instead of whole (1 tsp of each). It turned out the perfect spice level for people who like spice. Beautiful over rice. Will make again and again.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;drguzman;4;outstanding recipe - I added a tomato
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;diningdiva;5;I am on the South Beach diet and as near as I can figure this totally fits even in phase 1. It is so tasty and satisfying that it really helps as one of my diet staples :)
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;nettie;5;This dish was amazing. Made it into the recipe box in my kitchen. I did have to add chicken b/c my husband freaked a little when I said I was going to make it. But I just sauted the onion, garlic, and I added a little red pepper. Then added the chicken and slow cooked it, and followed the rest of the recipe. Wonderful!!!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;janisbeth;4;Good basic recipe that lends itself to all sorts of variations. My husband does not like chickpeas, but he asked for seconds. I used beans I had soaked and pre-cooked, and added a few scraps of turkey and some sweet corn, but it would have been good even without the additions, I think.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;karen;5;This makes the kitchen smell like an Indian restaurant. While the onion is cooking, I measure out all the spices into a small bowl to add all at once. I use crushed ginger root and ground cinnamon and add a can of petite diced tomatoes. Also I drain the bean juice and sub in water. This is a simple cheap meal and once you have all the spices together it is easy to make.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;pcperles;5;My husband and I loved this recipe. I used ground cinnamon instead of sticks, I added a tin of tomatoes and some fresh spinach that cooked down. It was so delicious and tasted very authentic. I will make this again for sure!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;natalie;1;I LOVE Indian food. Its my favorite food and I have been making Chana Masala myself with my own recipe for a few years now. I thought I would try somebody else's recipe. Honestly, this was not good and I thought it would have to be better than mine as so many people have reviewed it with good remarks. I will say the flavors are ok, but standard. The real problem is its too dry. There are no tomatoes in the recipe which you usually find in Chana Masala.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;nancydos;4;Great, tasty--perfect to satisfy your Indian cuisine cravings...just a few tips to share: if you're using dry chicpeas, you'll probably need to double your spices if you end up with a lot more than the equivalent of two cans as called for in the recipe...also, add that cayenne a half tsp at a tiime, or else you'll have a runny nose while you're eating this, 1-2 tsp of a good cayenne can knock your sinuses right out...if this does happen, as it did to me, add a half can of lite coconut milk, this helped...a bit. And DEFINITELY add a can of diced tomatoes in place of the liquid from your canned beans...it adds to the flavor and consistency...and it's still great and yummy even if you're out of tumeric or don't like coriander, instead add a dash of curry powder...That's about it, with a dash of salt...yum, yum, yummy.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;beadpm;5;combination of spices is sublime
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;bwalenz;5;I would cut back on the heat a little. Also, we didn't have coriander, so we used curry powder. It was DELICIOUS.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;mtia;5;I love the complexity of the flavors in this recipe! It's easy to prepare and tastes super authentic. As per some other reviews I left the liquid from the beans out and simply pureed some of the chickpeas. Serving it up with a dollop of plain yogurt was a hit with the vegetarian colleagues that I made it for and controlled the spice levels for those who's tastes preferred a milder option. Thank you for this recipe! :)
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;pc;4;I made this with double the seasonings and a can of diced,drained tomatos as recommended by others. I simmered the beans longer hoping they would absord more of the flavors, but it didn't do it as much as I'd hope. This dish was good nevertheless. However, the day after - this dish is awesome. It really taste great the following day once everything has had time to meld together. This was noted by many other commentors and I have to totally agree. I will make this recipe again, however next time, I will make a day in advance.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;breanahope;5;I made this a few weeks ago for the family. Everyone loved it! I served it over quinoa and it was super tasty! The spice mixture was PERFECT! One can alter the cilantro or chili content for individual taste and it will still create a lovely dish. I am making this again for tomorrow's dinner!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jdesmond;5;This recipe was great and easy to make. I made a large batch and served over brown rice. The leftovers were just as delicious. I can't handle cilantro so I omitted it - the curry was still wonderful.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;pomplemousse;4;This is pretty good! I made a smaller batch for myself since I'm the only one home for lunch this afternoon. I agree that this recipe needs some veggies--I'd definitely add a can of diced tomatoes next time, and maybe add some garam masala to it, but otherwise I find it delicious. Very easy and quick too! Thanks for the recipe!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;wsblend;4;very easy, and tasty. I doubled the dry spices except for the red pepper (by the way, I used 1/4 tsp ground cloves and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon), I used one large onion, and I used the liquid from only one of the cans of chickpeas and drained the other can.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;kristina;4;Big fan of this recipe! Had an intense craving for Indian this morning, and I love chickpeas, so this was the way to go, and I don't regret it! I didn't have coriander or tumeric on hand so omitted them, as well as the cilantro at the end (I was so eager to try it, I forgot till I was already halfway done with it). Added appx. 1/2 tsp yellow curry powder, which gave it an extra nice kick. Warning: Use the cayenne to taste - everyone's preferences for spice are different. I probably would have used 1/2 the amount: my face is still burning.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;emily;5;I added two chopped fresh tomatoes at the end--easy and inexpensive meal!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;underboss;4;Good, cheap, and very easy. Must put a can of tomatos in it though.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;merrimartin;3;It was ok...maybe the beans should stew for a big longer. I also had to add a lot more spices and about 4x more garlic.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;matt;5;I love this recipe...easy to make and tastes fantastic. I cut out the cayenne pepper as I'm not a big fan of spicy foods.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;rayeofsunshine;5;I made this recipe as directed, but added four cooked cubed potatoes and a can of diced tomatoes, just to give it something extra and make it stretch further. I left out the chickpea juice and added chicken broth instead. I made it at night and intended to make rice the next day to go along with it, but it was so good I never got around to making the rice! It tastes better the next day when the flavors have had a chance to blend. Will make again and again, and will try to make the rice at the same time!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;aarcanada;4;To use dry chickpeas instead of canned you will need to boil them for about 5 mins, discard the water, soak overnight, then cook in a pressure cooker for about ten mins. 1/2 tsp of gauram masala added just prior to serving makes a nice touch.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;sylwia;2;I did not like this at all. I put half the amount of cayenne pepper in and it was just right for the hot part. But somehow, the it tasted bland. My spices are fresh and I love curries. This is not worth the effort. I will try to fix this dish as i feel bad to throw it out...
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;stephanieconranfreeman;5;I compared this side to side with the other highly rated chickpea curry (the one with potatoes) from this site and this is SOOOO much better.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;gail;5;After reading the comments from previous members, I added 1 lrg can of tomatoes and additional seasoning.... 1 tsp Pataks curry seasoning and 1 tsp. Garam Marsala. Yummy! My husband raved over this recipe. We will definatly make again!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;cherisundaram;5;Delicious! I drained the chickpeas before I read the entire recipe. I added chicken broth for liquid and then a little cream at the end to get more gravy. It was flavorful, easy to make and my Indian family members loved it. I served it with rice and Trader Joe's Garlic Naan.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ashley;5;I made this recipe with just two servings, added a diced potato, and a dash of curry powder. I also didn't use the can juice and instead I used 1/2c of vegetable stock. This was sooo amazing! I wanted to eat the other servings, but when my dad saw what I was cooking he stole the rest! I'm definitely making this again later this week.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;kateburke;4;to cook dried chickpeas: crock on high for 5 hrs 1 and 1/2 cups of rinsed chickpeas with 4 cups water and a little salt. 1 lg onion only 1/2t cayenne 1 t cinn. couldn't find cloves or coriander in my cupboard!? served over rice with naan. Still pretty spicy.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;artsygirlstace;4;Didn't measure up to my fav indian restaurant but it was pretty good. Be careful how much cilantro you use! Yikes, that's a lot! and YES, this is SPICY. I like spicy though.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;windlessmeadow;4;I love this recipe :-) However, I do have my own spin on it. I use the same spice ratio but use only one can of chickpeas. Then I add one sweet potato, one or two carrots (depending on the size), and a can of crushed tomatoes. I cut up the root veggies into bit-size pieces. I also add the starchy liquid from the chickpeas to thicken it up. I serve the dish over couscous. We love this dish and eat it about once a week. It's full of good veggies, nutrients, and very little fat.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;victoria;4;Good curry that satisfies my cravings for Indian food. However, when I make it it seems like the beans don't seem to absorb enough of the flavors.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;carlakline;3;This recipe was ok, I give it 3.5 stars as is (with no modifications). I will make it again though. Next time I will use fresh ginger instead of the powder ginger... I think this is key.... something was missing though, I don't know what it was... the chickpeas were way too dry and I had to add water.... also the cayenne pepper is REALLY HOT and SPICY!, next time I'll add way less than what the recipe calls for... My chickpeas were soooo hot that I added some coconut milk to make it more mild... I also added some sugar, perhaps 2 tablespoons... At the end of the day my recipe was totally different than what I intended to do. It turned out pretty good though!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;vanessarenecarlson;4;I'd give this a 4.5, really. It was very good, even my hubby ate it, and he's most definitely NOT into beans of any sort. I served it over Jasmine rice, since that's what I had on hand. (Basmati rice would be more authentic). I did have to change the spices, since I didn't have all of them. So, I skipped the seasonings from the ginger on down, and used about 2 Tbs. of Rogan Josh seasoning from Penzey's Spices. (check them out!!) It's a blend of paprika, garlic, ginger, cumin, coriander, black pepper, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves and saffron. It was a very authentic Indian taste, and a nice bite to it. (not something I could give my kids, unfortunately) I'm sure, looking at the ingredient list, that it was pretty close to what the original recipe would taste like.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;aybarafaile;5;Fantastic! Cheap, healthy, quick, and delicious. The only thing I would change is add a little bit less of the cayenne. My face is still sweating.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;vivnidhi;3;This is coming from a person who makes curried chickpeas in a lot of ways and has been eating since childhood. Try lime juice to add tartness to this and yes, please add some more spices.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;snowsculpture;5;Really good recipe AND super easy! I also tried it with baby yellow potatoes and adding a little cream which I think I liked even better.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;dawnwintour;1;We made this after making 'Spinach Chick Pea Curry' also on this site. I recommend this recipe instead!! The cinnamon in this is overpowering, this tasted more like cookies than curry. Also, this recipe is doubled from what to me would be a normal size. My boyfriend made sure that I would give this rating the lowest possible. We will never make it again!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;danieldenhoed;4;This recipe was pretty good but I would give it 5 stars had it been a little saucier and more reminiscent of the Indian chickpea curries I love. I did follow the directions except used non canned beans so for the liquid I added a little veggie broth. I used ground ginger and cinnamon instead. Next time I might try same spices but add tomatoes and potatoes to it.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;mark;2;The dish was so-so, but not very fun and not worth the effort. Lacked complexity in flavor, which is odd considering the number of spices. We added spinach and a chopped tomato but it didn't help much. Other modifications included: using a cup of water instead of the bean liquid and not adding salt until the table.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;brittany1111;3;This had the potential to be really good. I followed the recipe, except for adding a little bit of heavy cream and served it over jasmine rice. The end result was just WAY too spicy. I would make it again, but next time I think 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper would be more than enough. I couldn't even finish a small serving and my mouth is still burning.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;janeth;5;This is delicious! I made half the recipe because I didn’t think my kids would like it. After eating their food, they devoured what was left of this dish. My daughter asked me to make it again tomorrow. I ate this with a salad and it made a filling meal. This will become a regular in our home.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;allison;5;Thank you for this recipe! Very quick and perfect for introducing someone to curry (as I did last night)! Added quite a bit more spice and thinly sliced carrots, celery, mushrooms, and green pepper, though. Brown rice works very well!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;leni;5;Delicious, healthy, and cheap! Added diced tomatoes and kale- fabulous.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;willandjenn2004;3;"Ok, I feel bad giving this a 3 but It's just not very good without adding your own alterations. I made the recipe ""as is"" and was NOT happy with the flavour. After adding Curry, potato, sweet potato, salt, and a couple Tbl. of heavy cream. It was good enough to eat. Still not mind blowing. Great base though. Thank you Served with ""Indian Saffron Rice"" & Naan both recipes found on this site as well... TRY THE NAAN! It's easy and TASTY!!"
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;rosegrabowski;5;"Delicious! I agree with those reviewers who said this is the right amount of spices if you use fresh (and freshly ground.) Highly recommend buying a $20 spice grinder, makes a big difference for dishes like thsi. I also added a couple potatoes (steamed and cut into 1""-2"" cubes) and it added some nice texture alterations. Only weird thing was biting into a whole clove or piece of cinnamon - I'd recommend crushing the cinnamon to the point that the pieces are quite small and taking the cloves out after cooking."
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;elizabethcramer;5;SOOOOOOO GOOOOOODDDD!!! I use this all the time, when I am serving it to my friends, I go light on the spices, but for me I use them all. I love spice!!! This is a great meal for a vegetarian!!!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ehtraill;3;An okay recipe. I added cream to the mixture to make it more saucy. Omit the cilantro. Good blend of spices with flavors at the beginning and the end of bites. I think that there would be better recipes to try that wouldn't take the adjusting that I needed to do to get a good flavor
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;h;5;Great ant easy recipe ! It is very fast to make, and my husband loved it. Will definitely be making this again.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;audreyeickwort;5;I followed others suggestion and added canned tomatoes. This is excellent with the Kiwi Raita recipe, which is a complement to the spiciness.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;muypicante;5;I was back in the US for a bit and was missing Indian food, so I made this for my mom for lunch. We both absolutely loved it! We used ground cinnamon in place of the stick and mashed up the chickpeas a bit, like another reviewer said to do.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;kbatilla;5;My rooommate and I love this recipe. It's fast and simple. I cut down prep time by mixing the spices together first. I've made this for an every day meal and for a dinner party. We can't get enough.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;starinyte;4;If it were possible, I'd give this recipe 4 1/2 stars because I thought the flavor was was great, but I added alot of extra ingredients. Baked sweet and Yukon gold potatoes, a can of diced tomatoes, green and yellow peppers and some red pepper flakes. It was delish, but not exactly the same recipe anymore...
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;lumarga;5;Next time I will serve with rice...maybe jazmine rice.ummmmfm,My husband gave a 10.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;cooknva;5;"This is my 3rd time making this curry and I think its great! I followed everyone elses recommendation to double, if not, treble the spices used(to tell you the truth I sprinkled spice til it acquired enough for my taste). I added half a vegetarian vegetable bouillon and also added some garam marsala just for the extra ""zing"". Another recommendation for all the vegetarians out there that aren't keen on chickpeas. Try soy chunks!! It works!"
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;lucida113;5;Used frozen kale instead of cilantro at the end. And added large shrimp, halved lengthwise for protein. On brown rice. There was enough chick peas left over, so I made a hummus with them...gorgeous!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;cmyd;4;"My husband really liked this; my 3-year-old, not so much. We ate it with naan and mango chutney. I halved the recipe, and added 1/2 cooked chopped sweet potato. I also followed the recommendation of another reviewer and drained the chickpeas and added ground cinnamon. (I also used whole cardamon, well-smashed, because I was out of ground.)"
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;kimberlysgeorge;5;I didn't have cinnamon sticks so I just added about a tsp of ground cinnamon. Excellent dish. Couldn't stop eating it.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;danib;5;Great recipe! I didn't use the liquid from the chickpeas because canned liquid is usually tinny. I substituted about 1 1/3 cup homemade veggie broth. I did mash up a little bit of the chickpeas right at the end for thickness. I also simmered for about 25 minutes to let the flavors mix. I had some Thai lemon basil I needed to use so I threw that in with the cilantro. Good but not necessary. It had a great spice - for those who don't like spice I would use less than 1 tsp. red pepper. Overall - I loved it and would definitely make it again! My boyfriend, who thinks Indian food is horrible, loved this! I'm trying to ease him into it! Thanks for the great recipe!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;b;4;Very good recipe, though a little hotter than I was expecting. To make a meal I added boiled potatoes, peas and a can of tomatoes.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ultranuclearmaga;5;Fantastic! I followed the recipe as written, but rinsed the chick peas first and added a 1/2c of stock to simmer and thicken. I served it over brown rice. The next time, I'll make a double recipe it was that good.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;wramos;5;This recipe was AWESOME!!! I took others advise and added 14.5oz diced tomatoes which in opinion is a MUST for this recipe. Also I doubled the spices but left out the turmeric (didn't have) & cayenne since I was serving to my 5yr old. I also used ground cinnamin/cloves and added 1-1/2 tbls of curry powder. I rinsed the beans and added 1 can of vegi broth to make a gravy and served over white rice. Hubby wasn't too keen on all the spices but I absolutely loved this and will definately make it again albeit just for me :D
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;gapch1026;5;I love curry and the combination of spices in this recipe made for a very nicely spiced dish. I added two small tomatoes, a thinly sliced Yukon Gold potato and the only other thing I did differently was to rinse and drain the chickpeas (only 1 can!) but add a 5.5 oz can of tomato juice to substitute for the liquid and lend some additional color and flavor to the dish. I let it simmer the 20 minutes that the rice was cooking. No additional thickener required. When I reheated the leftovers, I added more liquid (just water), about a tsp of purchased curry powder, and a handful of raisins. The more this simmers and the flavors blend, the better it is!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;bobbieanne;5;Great and easy recipe. I have a channa masala recipe that is similar in taste to this but requires many more spices (and is therefore more expensive to make). I made no changes to this at all, but I do suggest grating the ginger instead of chopping it. Using a parmesan cheese grater works really well. And if you're looking for this as a main dish (great served over brown rice), it won't be enough for 8 people, so you'll want to adjust it a bit.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;krispy;5;This is absolutely spectacular. I've made it numerous times for friends, potlucks,and just myself. When I make it for myself, For those who like the spicier side of things, just add more, especially cumin. Even more importantly for me, it's easy!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;dawn;5;Very good--my Indian husband liked it.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jnavani;4;Just made this curry! Finally a recipe that comes out good..even with using canned garbanzo beans. This dish truly was a delight! Easy to make and tasted great with white rice or naan.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;habsfan1993;4;Following the other reviews, I added a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes and doubled the spices. It always impresses! I serve it with either rice or naan. A dollop of yogurt cools it just enough for those not used to the spice.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;medford63;5;Good and easy to make, other than measuring out all the spices. I took other reviewers' suggestions and used 1 tsp ground cinnamon instead of cinnamon sticks and added a can of tomatoes (I might add some potatoes next time). I used one can of water instead of the chickpea juice. I used 3/4 tsp cayenne but wish I would've gone for the whole 1 tsp (I like spicy). I didn't add salt until the end (I have a low salt tolerance) and served over basmati rice. It made the house smell really good! I would make this again.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;katherinegrace;1;I had to throw this out. I made the recipe exactly as the recipe says, and it was awful. It tasted flat and did not have the high amplitude flavor that I enjoy in a curry.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ldensven;4;This was just what I was looking for. But definitely better the next day. I took other reviewers' advice and added 14 oz canned diced tomato, 1/2 tsp of cloves, 1 tsp. ground cinnamon. I also added a bit of garlic salt and some curry to taste. I love, love, love, cilantro so that made all the difference in the end. My hubby is not a fan of cilantro so the dish wasn't not his favorite. Too bad for him. He can eat steak!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ssharp;5;This was a GREAT healthy recipe!! I followed the recipe exactly to form a base for the rest of the dish. I allowed the curry to cook for the 20min it took to make the rice. I added chunks of carrot, and some tomato wedges for the last 15min. Served with fresh tomato, which was seriously necessary because this was insanely HOT!! Next time, I'm going to start with 1/4tsp of cayenne, then add to taste.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;motheroffour;4;Wow! I would love to give this 5 stars, but as written the recipe was way to spicy. I would recommend the following adjustments, use only 1 tsp. ginger root, 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper and 1/2 tsp ground turmeric.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;sugarmagnoliafl;4;This was very tasty. I did not have onion, so used a combonation of carrots and celery. I also did not have the cilantro, so used the celery greens. I served this over brown rice. The next time I think I'll add a can of diced tomatoes and a dollop of plain yogurt on the top.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;sharney;5;Thanks this was real good,a nice change from a chicken or beef curry,and I did not even miss the meat or feel as if something was missing.I added some courgette and aubergine as another reviewer had,and double the recipe,I will be making again.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;emily;4;Use only 1/2 cayenne pepper, use ground cloves, and add 1 cup of water at least (but not juice from can).
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;hpuk;4;this was very good, and satisfied my curry cravings. It was pretty easy to put together, and I served it over rice. I used ground cinnamon, as other reviewers suggested, but otherwise I followed recipe exactly. Next time I might put in some veggies, to give it more variety.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;pbarden;3;Flavourful, but on the spicy side.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;acastro;5;This was really good, and really fast, great for a week night. The only thing I did differently was to double or more the spices (as a matter of preference) and add a little garam masala towards the end. I will definitely be making this again soon!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;magda;5;I've never made a curry in my life before, until this one, and I have to say, it tastes great. Exactly what I think a curry should taste like. It's probably very easy to add meat to it as well. I do like spicy food, and this one really was.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ccahoon;5;Completely delicious and makes a lot of food!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;laniamohr;2;too spicy
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;mvaden;4;the more spices the better and the more you simmer the better. love this with naan.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jessicastephens;3;This recipe is a very good base. I think next time though, I'll add some tomatoes and potatoes. I love chickpeas, but it just seemed to lack something. Also, I like things spicy, so I'll probably increase the heat a bit. Thanks for sharing and thanks for reading!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;shun;4;It was pretty good.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;sandramcintyre;4;Lovely, and made the kitchen smell delicious! Drained the liquid from the can by accident, then added 3/4 cup water with 1 tsp. cornstarch and chicken soup base in the last five minutes of cooking, for liquid and texture.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;sumehra;5;The first time I made this, I didn't have any ginger, onions, or cilantro on me and it still turned out EXCELLENT. The second time I made it I added onions and it was still very good, but I prefer it without the veggies. I also like to let the sauce thicken a lot by evaporation.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ak808;4;OMG, this was really spicy! I'm usually pretty tolerant of spicy food but this was a bit much, even when served over rice. Adding 1 can of diced tomatoes really improved this dish, adding more depth and texture to it. Next time I'll try to add more veggies. But overall, a very good base that can be easily built upon.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ginnydooley;5;I just made this and it is THE best!!! SO much flavor and SO inexpensive to make. A great addition for any starving students who want something delicious and easy. I will DEFINITELY add this to my favorites. I loved the spices just as the recipe called for. If you're not sure for yourself, do smaller amounts and then add more according to your own taste. It's a keeper!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;alissakate;5;This was great! So easy, and so healthy! I'm definitely making it again.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;kalex;4;This was great! It is very spicy, I would recommend cutting back on the cayenne. I also don’t think I crushed the cinnamon well enough. We didn’t like the texture of the cinnamon pieces. I think next time I’ll just use ground cinnamon and ground cloves instead of whole. Since there are only two of us I made a ½ recipe but I wish I would have made the whole thing and frozen half for a quick meal down the road. I served it over rice and it was great. It would also be good with naan or pita. I also thought it would be great mixed with rice and served cold as a salad. We definitely loved this and will make it often. Update: I just tried this again with 1/8 tsp of each ground cinnamon & ground clove and now it's a 5 star!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;kbelanger;4;"so yummy! I added chopped green apples and a pear as well; the tartness and sweetness of the fruit brightens up the chickpeas. I also usually add about double the cinnamon and the curry. I second whoever reviewed who said the cilantro is a must. I add it just before I serve the curry, and the one time I didn't, a layer of flavour was definetely missing. This has become a staple recipe for me. Inexpensive and so tasty!"
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;maile;1;I don't know if I did something wrong but I did not care for this recipe. I followed the recipe to a T but it was just so bland!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;mangowww;5;soo easy and just that flavor and ingredient combination that I like :)
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;kimbee;5;This is a great recipe for Chickpea curry allthough it is very spicy, I added some plain yoghurt to tone it down a tad. I also added some left over cold chicken to the dish. Served with Nan bread and brown rice. Plenty for the next day which I thought had a better flavour.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;maryanneflynnpoeschl;5;I loved this! It is yummy and filling, and just as good the next day!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;nubianqueen;5;I just finished making this recipe and I thought it was delicious. It is quite spicy, however, (which I love) so if you don't like spice I wouldn't recommend this dish. I used 1 large onion (instead of 2), 1 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ground cloves since I didn't have whole and I added 1 diced potato because I thought it was too liquidy when I added the chickpeas. I let it simmer for about 45 minutes. I ate it with naan bread. Will definitely make this again.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;everfair;5;Great recipe! I subbed curry powder (Javin Brand...the best!) for the spices, skipped the ginger, and added fresh carrots and canned peas. A good vegetarian recipe that even my carnivorous fiance devoured over rice. Surprisingly, this was also good cold, as I brought it to school but didn't have a microwave to heat it up!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;neoclassy;4;I think it took a day for the flavors to really blend. It was a tad bland after I first made it, but the leftovers were tastier. Thumbs up, though!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ron;4;First time I've done anything Indian....never tasted so many flavors in one dish - number of different spices is the reason. We all loved it. Didn't change anything in the recipe other than not putting all the liquid from the chickpea can into the dish - just a couple of ounces. My 14yr old son even enjoyed it!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;islandazul;4;This was a pretty good recipe for chole/chana masala. Different than the kind in the restaurant, because it has much less fat, but still yummy! I didn't change much - added a can of diced tomatoes (for color and a little sweetness), and added 1/2 tps more of each spice to compensate for the additional volume of the tomatoes. I also added 1 tps of cinnamon and boiled the 2 cinnamon sticks whole. Fresh spices are a must! Will definitely make again.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;foujean;5;"Excellent vegetarian recipe that even my children enjoy. Friends have commented that it brought them back to their childhood and reminded them of ""Mom's cooking"". I decreased the amount of onions and added bell peppers, eggplant and zucchini. Also added a teaspoonful of Madras curry. Will definitely be making this again."
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;quarter;4;Made this and added part of a butternut squash and half a cauliflower head. Pretty good, next time I will add a little more cayenne or cumin- something spicy.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jemmassong;2;I love curry and Mid-East cuisine...but this recipe was not at all what I expected. It wasn't terrible, just not exciting in any way. I think there is just too much Garbanzo and too much onion and the wrong blend (amount-wise) of spices...Nothing that I did seemed to help it. I probably won't make it again.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;cherwilsoniannarino;5;This was amazing! I was very nervous to try this. DH and I have gently been trying more vegetarian meals, and I have never been a garbanzo bean fan. This was great! And spicy, which we love! I did drain the beans and add a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes. A little vegetable broth may be in order as well.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;riverchic;1;not a fan. my boyfriend said it tastes like a certain vegan restaurant food that he despises. too much onion, and i put onion in about everything i cook. would have used ground cinn had i known id be picking cinnamon sticks out of my mouth.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;rachelmiegel;5;This recipe was so good that after I finished it up I decided to make it again. My only complaint is that it's a bit on the spicy side, and I love spicy food. It was too spicy for my boyfriend to eat, so he wasn't able to have any. The second time I made it I used ground cinnamon rather than grinding my own. Even though I put the sticks in the food processor to crush them, they still had chunks of stick in them.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;purplepopsicle;4;Very tasty! As suggested in another review, I used half of the amount of cayenne pepper. Next time I will use ground cinnamon instead of the actual sticks.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;sly50;4;This was very, very good. I had to make certain substitutions due to what was on hand but it did't seem to matter. I look forward to making it again exactly as written. i'm sure it will be even better.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;libbyshearerfarmen;5;"This is amazing. I was skeptical at first, but both my husband and I were like ""wow!"" I recommend using less pepper unless you like REALLY spicy food. I think about 1/3 t is perfect for us. I did slightly modify it- only one can of ckickpeas and I added one large chopped chicken breast as well as one can chopped tomatoes. I'm going to make it again this week! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!"
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;beckythecooker;3;WOW this was spicy! I didn't expect it. I'm going to cut down the cayenne pepper to 1/4 tsp next time. I also thickened it with corn starch. The blend of spices was excellent and reminded me of my favorite Indian restaurant. Delicious, but for the heat.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;batikwindmillturban;2;My only change was to use powdered ginder, however it became clear I wouldnt have enough liquid following the recipe exactly. I was able to achieve a good consistency by adding a can of condensed tomato soup and 1/2 cup heavy cream (from Butter Chickpea Curry Recipe from this site). I substituted spinach for cilantro since I dont like cilantro, but the main problem with this recipe was that all the spices clashed with one another resulting in a strange spicy taste in which no one flavor won out. Ive had chickpea curry in Pakistani homes and this did not simtulate me. My spices were not old either.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;chennechic;4;I added diced tomatoes, very tasty. Would be good with potatoes too.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;connie;2;I made this recipe exactly as stated with the exception of using 1 tsp cinnamon in place of the cinnamon stick. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but it didn't come out very good. The spices were so overpowering that they canceled each other out and it tasted very bitter over all.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;cm;5;Very tasty. Based on suggestions from previous reviewers, we substituted a teaspoon of cinnamon for the stick, halved the cayenne pepper, and minced half of the chickpeas to give the meal a bit more texture. Served with brown rice, and quite tasty! This will definitely be on our rotation.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;silverstar3;5;This is a great recipe!!!! I added cooked cubed potatoes to the chick peas and this is a great one pot meal. I also used hot peppers because we like spicy Indian food.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;pinkypink;2;This was okay. This dish turned out really spicy. I let it sit at least a day before eating it to let the flavours melt together. I'm biased in this review, because I eat authentic curries regularly from great Indian/Pakistani restaurants. If you're looking for a western-style curry, this recipe would be good for you because it is a good, simple, recipe.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;nycveggies;5;This was easy and yummy. I would add extra vegetable broth next time to make a sauce. I only added half the cayenne, next time I may add a tad bit more.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;melanie1974;4;VERY HOT. I had to add some yogurt and honey to take some of the heat out. I love spicy food but this was borderline unpleasant. This would be better with maybe 3/4 teaspoon cayanne and a little honey.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;saliter5;5;Amazingly easy and wonderful. I added 2/3 a teaspooon cinnamon and added cilantro that comes in the tubes at the grocery store. We'll make again. Is a little hot, cut back the cayenne if you don't like the heat.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;laurie;5;My husband and I thought it was Absolutely Amazing!! Didn't change a thing! I cannot rave enough about how great this dish is.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;aj;2;ARGH this was way too spicy for me, I couldn't eat it. I'm not usually that wimpy about spicy food. My husband could tolerate it. Might try again without the cayenne pepper.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;rebe424;3;This recipe needed more spice for flavor and also needed to cook longer to get a better consistency. I also added two cubed potatoes to increase the density of the curry and add to the flavor.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;melissa;5;Delicious and SO EASY curry!! As one reviewer mentioned, try to use spices which have not been in your cabinet for eons for maximum flavor. Try adding a can of drained tuna, a can of drained diced tomatoes, or a can of diced potatoes (or any combination of those) for some extra weight!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;lobsteriffic;4;This was very different from most Indian chickpea dishes I have had. More of a sidedish. That being said, I really liked the subtle sweet flavour of this dish. Will probably make again.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;hungryhungry;3;It was a passable dish but definitely room for improvement on the spices. I wasn't a bit fan of the cinnamon and if I try this recipe again, I will have to remember to put the cloves in a cheesecloth or something. Biting into one of those isn't the tastiest thing ever..
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;drtbone;4;Great Curry Dish without the Curry! My wife even liked this dish and that's saying a lot. The only problem I had was that I didn't crush the spices enough and there was crunchy pieces (might use bottled spices next time, or just use more arm strength). Even better the next day, and the day after that.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;rubyruth;5;This is a quick and healthy meal that tastes great. I added finely chopped potatoes with the onions, and added some chicken to make it more hearty. The potatoes give a nice texture and flavor. Also, if you don't have all of the seasonings- some of them are less common for the average American cook, and I can't find them in Taiwan- you can just put curry powder in place of the tumeric, coriander, cayenne pepper and cumin and it still turns out delicious (although I'm sure using all of the fresh seasonings as the recipe calls for is better).
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;isabellegreen;4;This is my second time making this. I would give it five stars if it weren't for the cayenne pepper. The first time I put in 1 teaspoon and our mouths were on fire. The second time I put a dash and it was perfect. I never use the liquid of the chickpeas so I used my homemade chicken broth instead. Served on couscous... delicious!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;vic;4;it was a nice change from what we normally have. i did deviate a little though, i added some leftover rotisserie chicken and mashed potatoes to help thicken it up some. also added some chicken broth. needless to say, i had to pretty much triple the spices called for. it was good, i thought it could have been a little spicier still though!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;carlyg;3;I felt like this was over-spiced and didn't allow much of the taste of the ingredients to come through. It needs some tweaking I think.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;kornelimuenster;3;I normally like this combination of spices but I wasn't happy at all with the curry, had to add coconut and curry powder to make it edible. Sorry maybe just not my thing.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;007librarian;5;I made this recipe exactly as written minus the cilantro and we just loved it! I served it over plain rice because that's all I had, but I'll try another variety next time. I need fresher spices to give this more taste, and will buy some now that I found a good recipe to use them in!!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;southernflavor;5;Awesome! Added flour and water for thickness and more gravy. This was absolutely delicious on top of my chicken flavored yellow rice.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;badkittty1;4;Very yummy! We added chicken to the mix as well. Will definitely make again.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;rachelle;2;It was okay -- nothing special though. I don't think I'll be making this again.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;loveggies;5;Will definitely be making this again! I've been looking for an easy curry recipe, and this one really is good. I blended about half of the garbanzo beans with a hand blender towards the end of cooking for a creamier texture. I even cheated on some of the spices and it was still delish! Thanks!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;amanda;3;I thought it was ok. My boyfriend really didn't like it at all. I thought the flavors needed more depth, it was hot but there was no layering of flavors. If I made it again I'd add a tablespoon of sugar, potatoes, and some meat to make it more interesting.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;porusgirl;4;"This is quite good. I followed the recipe exactly with a few minor changes...I used Extra Virgin Olive Oil instead of Vegetable Oil; 1-Tsp Ground Ginger instead of Ginger Root; 1/2-Tsp Ground Cloves instead of Whole Cloves and 1-Tsp Ground Cinnamon instead of Cinnamon Sticks. Let it simmer for about 45 minutes. Served it over White Rice. This dish is definitely a keeper."
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;rickie;5;Easy, healthy, and great flavor. I add a can of diced tomatos and use dried spices.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;amandam;4;"Very tasty. Different and special, but ""friendly"" enough that my 89 year-old grandmother took seconds too! The smells it fills the house with are wonderful also. If you'd like to try using the cinnamon sticks, break them up a bit and then put them in a pint mason jar and add your blender attachment. Whirl until fine. The aroma when you do this is incredible. I also agree: fresh spices are a MUST for this. If you don't regularly cook with cumin and turmeric, it's very likely that yours are too old."
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;sharon;5;I made this last night and it was very, very tasty, and pretty. I added some tomatoes to it like someone else said they did. It was so good, I'm making some more for potluck at church tomorrow! Its a keeper!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;pattyjo;4;This was good, but in our opinion it needed much more flavor. We are big fans of indian food, and really enjoy the flavors. We found it a bit bland (it had enough spice, but just not flavor for us), but we know it has huge potential for us if we add additional spices. Thanks for the recipe!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;arual;5;Love this recipe. I cut it in half. I also rinse the chickpeas to reduce the salt. Thanks
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;kybecky;4;"Made this for husband and two friends, and it went over very well. Added potatoes, (undrained) canned tomatoes as mentioned by other reviewers, and I mashed some of the chickpeas. I didn't have coriander; I'll buy it before I make it again. Used ground ginger instead of fresh. The curry ended up a little dry for my taste -- that's the reason for 4 stars, and next time I will add more water. I served it over basmati rice, but hubby and I prefer jasmine (although I know that's not as authentic). Ooh, and I made the chapati bread - it smoked up the house, but it sure added to the meal!"
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;blairglass;5;My husband and I are always in search of recipes with the following qualities: quick, easy, budget friendly, and healthy. We also try to eat vegetarian at least once or twice a week. We like trying new flavors but do not usually cook a lot of curry-based dishes. We both found this recipe to be delicious and very filling. We served it over jasmine rice as another reviewer recommended. Now that we have all of the spices in the house (we only had to buy one or two items, I believe) then the only ingredients we will need to pick up to make this in the future will be the chickpeas and an onion. We will definitely be making this again soon.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;amym;4;"My husband and I are big Indian food fans, so we had to try this. It was pretty easy to make, and tasted great. We doubled most of the spices though; the flavor of the original recipe was a little subtle for us. Delicious over basmati rice!"
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;tortugas2x;5;I am not a huge fan of Indian food, and I’ve certainly never attempted to make curry on my own, but this stuff is delish! I used only one can of drained chickpeas, and added one big red potatoe (cubed), 2 big sliced carrots, half a green pepper plus one can of broth. As suggested, I mashed up some of the chick peas and halved the pepper. This is easy to make, tasty, cheap and not bad for you... What else can you ask for. Plus considering that many reviewer has adapted this recipe to suit their personal tastes, it’s also flexible. OH... I didn’t have any cumin! Will definitely make again. My husband will never eat, but it’s perfect for me for lunch! THANKS for sharing.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;mollybennett;4;First of all, let me say that this was a good one overall, but I couldn't find chili paste anywhere! I used chili sauce instead and I do not recommend it. The sauce tasted like ketchup with a tiny bit of kick to it. To make up for the lacking paste, I added some red pepper, chili powder and cumin, probably 1 t., 1/2 t. and 1/2 t. respectively. The sauce smelled so good, but I was disappointed at the lack of flavor. I'm sure the chili paste would have remedied that a bit. I pressed, froze and pan seared my tofu before adding it. Also, I cooked all of the other ingredients together for about 15 minutes so that the tofu could soak up the flavor and added the bok choy for only about final 3 minutes. It was still a tad crunchy that way. This is a keeper, but next time, I'm going to spice it up!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jayviolet;5;WOW! What a great recipe! I substituted 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon for sticks, ground ginger for fresh and added dried coriander (sprinkled to my liking) as these are what I had on hand. I let everything cook together for approx. 10-15 or until most of the liquid was absorbed and served over white rice. Will definitely be making this again - thank you for sharing.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;razberiswrl;4;This was really good for a quick lunch, but it seemed to *need* something. I even added cumin seed and extra garlic to give it more depth of flavor. It was pretty thick too. I may add some water to the leftovers, and simmer it covered for an hour to see what happens. Also, the recipe calls for WAY too much cayenne IMO, I used about half the recommended amt, and it was a tad too spicy when eaten with rice. I'm not a weenie when it comes to spicy food either!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;lana;5;This is a great dish that is so easy to make. I have two small children, so I used only half the cayenne pepper, but it was still too spicy for them so I had to add yoghurt to cut the bite. (I love the spiciness so I added crushed red pepper to my portion!) I used ground cinnamon and almost double of the remaining spices. YUMMY!!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;thebutterfly;4;so good,i was searching for a good chickpea recipe...finally i got this.really delicious and everyone liked it. but i didnt have coriander also i skipped cloves and double the spices with some 2tbsp cream. perfect with rice and salad.yummy
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ann;4;yummy, nice warm flavor--inexpensive and very filling! Served both of us plus some leftover. Adding bread and a salad would probably serve 4 easily.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;heidihabeckjohnson;5;Thank you for a wonderful and easy recipe. It turned out great.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;curlygirl;4;I often double or triple spices in recipes because I like a lot of flavor, but didn't find that necessary with this recipe. It packed a lot more punch than I expected! It was tasty, but I think I'd like to mash the garbanzo beans a little bit next time.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;chumler;5;Yummy! I modified the heck out of this recipe, but the basic list of ingredients returned a delightful little dish. My husband ran out for pizza and wings and by the time he got back I was already sitting down with my dinner.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;saraw;5;Soooo delicious!!! I'm not sure what some of the reviewers are talking about when they say this has no flavor. I made a few adjustments. I added 1/2 cup of coconut milk, and I added 2 medium sized potatoes and it was excellent. I didn't have coriander salt, but the recipe still came out very delicious. Also, I added a little of bit of brown sugar because the cayenne pepper was a bit overwhelming. Next time I would cut back to about 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, I love spicy food, but this was just too much, but the brown sugar helped tone it down. Thanks for the recipe!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;amytron;4;Ever since first trying this recipe in September, it has become a regular dinner in our house. Its a favourite when we are all a bit broke, and only have a few dollars to buy a few ingrediants. So its very economical! A few changes I make: I use one can of chickpeas (drained) I add one can of crushed tomatoes. I add one chopped birds eye chilli (for a bit of bite) If I want to make the curry a bit bulkier, I add some par boiled sweet potato or pumpkin.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;winf;4;Way too much cinnamon and chickpeas for my personal taste. Cut back to 1/2 tsp. Next time, will only use 1 can of beans but keep the rest the same. Took the advice and drained the liquid from the beans and substitute with approximately 2 cups of water. Added already cooked chicken. For some reason, my turned out a bit watery, so added a bit of cornstarch to thicken it up. Otherwise, tastes very similar to what i get in a resturant!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;cadon23;5;I didn´t have all the proper ingredients to make this (getting Indian spices in Poland can be a challenge) and it was still delicious!! I have since gotten all the spices I need and can´t wait to make it again.. plus, it was so easy! :)
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;kinnl;4;I was always intimidated by Indian cuisine (making it not eating it) because of all the unfamiliar spices, but this recipe is a great one to start with - simple with really good results. I didn't follow the recipe exactly though. I added some cubed potatoes between the onion and spice stage. I doubled all the spices except for the cayenne pepper and cinnamon. I accidentally drained the chickpeas liquid away so I used the equivalent amount of chicken broth, which was a nice addition. Finally, I added fresh tomatoes at the end. We enjoyed it with plain (Greek) yogurt and nan. I will definitely make this again.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;loririverstonenewell;5;I subbed carrots for 1/2 the potatoes, used crushed tomatoes and coconut milk (as suggested by other reviewers) instead of soup. I had half a bag of peas in the freezer and threw them in... finally, I doubled the spices! YUM! Everyone loved it. Best curry at our house yet.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;milehighcook;5;This is so delicious and EASY! I like it with chickpeas or with petite green peas. It's a good meal to make when we're tired of meat. I always reduce the amount of cayenne pepper to taste.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;susan;4;This dish was good. Even better on the second day as leftovers. I think I will cut back on the cayenne pepper next time. I like spicy but it was a little too much for me! Would taste good with potatoes!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;sharon;5;INCREDIBLE recipe! Very authentic, very satisfying, and the cilantro in it is amazing. Couldn't get enough of it!!!! very quick and easy to make too
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;lucy;4;I made this last night for my fiance and a friend. They both thought it was too hot but I liked it.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;cindyrobert;5;This recipe was delicious. I doubled the spices as usual and it turned out really good!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;sueblankenshippaschke;5;Spicy and full of flavor. Used ground cinnimon and skipped the cloves for the best result.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;dlish;5;This recipe was great. I added a can of tomatoes and some indian eggplant and let it simmer for about 40min. Indian cuisine is the only food where I don't miss the meat. Fantastic!!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;blndpixybabe;5;I love this! First curry I ever made, and it tasted just like my local indian place. I just added some walnuts for crunch, but otherwise wouldn't change anything. Gets better overnight. :)
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;thenightingale;3;This was my first experience with Indian food and I am not impressed. More than likely it is my unexperienced palate, but this was very spicy to me. I found myself picking out the bits of cinnamon sticks. Maybe this cuisine just isn't for me.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;evaamber;5;Soooo good! I followed the recipe exactly and it was a huge hit!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;colers12;4;Tried to crush the cinammon sticks and ended up having to pick them all out while eating...would not crush them rather cook them whole and pull them out at the end. This was very good though! I enjoyed the spice! Will definately make again and maybe add some chicken or broccoli.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ckurian;5;I love chickpeas and I have tried making chickpea curry using various recipes. This one is the best so far. I added lesser cayenne pepper than the recipe called for. So, the curry tasted a little sweet (from the cinnamon). I will add the full amount next time. I also added a fresh plum tomato which added to the flavor. I am going to try making the curry by adding cauliflower to it next time.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;strawberi;5;I LOVED this recipe!!! It really had the curry flavour I've been looking for. Even my toddler ate it up (but I mixed yogurt with his to lessen the spice). I did add potatoes and tomatoes as others suggested and garam masala for more spice and it was a hit.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;bradystrackman;5;Loved this recipe, and can't believe some people find it bland. It is definitely hot and there is quite a strong ginger and cinnamon taste, so cut back on these if you don't like these flavors. We just cooked it as is and thought it was great.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;westerwoman;2;Where's the flavor? Neither I nor my husband cared for this at all. I offered to try and make it better next time, but he said not to even bother.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jillala;4;I never follow recipes exactly... just taste them a lot and keep adding things until it tastes good! To this recipe I added: - 1/2 can coconut milk - doubled the cumin - 1 teaspoon Splenda (some mango chutney is nice for sweetness too!) - 3 teaspoons lemon juice - a few extra cloves... 10 total. - 3 heaping teaspoons tomato paste - 1 teaspoon Garam Masala I DID use the Cayenne this time, but I think I'll substitute crushed red chillies next time... still get the heat, but more flavour... might need more than a teaspoon though!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;closetbetty;4;It was good, but didn't have an outstanding flavour. I rinsed and drained my garbanzo beans (always!), and added a can of diced tomatoes. I will try this recipe again though, but tinker with the spicing.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;gena;3;Needs salt!! I thought the recipe was too ginger-y also. I don't like to be mean, but it was only okay.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;brookeelizabeth;5;This was great!! Instead of oil, I used vegetable broth (about 1/3 cup) to cook the onions. Also, I only used half the cayenne pepper called for and it was still VERY spicy, so be careful adding your spices. Great, authentic taste. This was my first Indian dish, and I'm really glad I chose this one!!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;virus;5;This recipe was really great. The flavors were a rainbow and rollercoaster for your mouth. The cinnamon was a bit big - didn't really crush up well and not fun to eat big chunks - I need practice. Also picking out the cloves may not be up everyone's alley. You can add more heat and saltiness if necessary. Definitely a keeper!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;riaferry;4;We added the diced tomatoes as suggested. Very hot and very wonderful.I will tone down the cayenne next time for my daughter. She asked why I made lava for dinner..Kids..
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;raechel;5;Indian food is one of both my partner's and my favourite types of food -- we have become quite the connoisseurs over the years, having tried countless restaurants all over the country (with only a couple living up to our high expectations). This was the first time I attempted to prepare a curry dish from scratch, and was I ever impressed! I can’t believe anyone thinks this dish is bland! I prepared as instructed, although I added a green pepper and some halved grape tomatoes. While cooking, I mashed the chickpeas a bit with a wooden spoon. I also used much less cilantro than called for (as per my personal taste). Also, I removed the cloves before serving (over brown rice). A healthy and delicious meal!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jasmine;4;Yum! I used ground cinnamon and I sauteed mushrooms with the 1 large onion I used in butter. Also, I substituted diced tomatoes for the garbanzo bean water. I used much less cayenne than called for so my kiddos could eat it. YUM! Loved this recipe.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jasminecouillard;4;Yum! I used ground cinnamon and I sauteed mushrooms with the 1 large onion I used in butter.

5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;karyn;5;this was delicious. i only used some of the liquid from the peas, using mostly vegetable broth instead. also, i substituted ground cinnamon for the cinnamon sticks, and omitted the cumin because i forgot to pick it up at the store. everything turned out just fine. i'm definitely making this again.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;evilivy;5;simple and delicious, thanks!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ann;4;I REALLY LIKED THIS RECIPE AND WILL MAKE IT AGAIN BUT NEXT TIME I WILL ADD SOME COOKED POTATO CHUNKS
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;brandi;5;We tried this dish last night and it was delicious! In fact, I can't stop thinking about it. I went right out to the store and bought more chickpeas so we can make it again soon. We substituted Sauer's brand curry powder for all the spices (used about 4 tsps), and the result was out of this world. Also, we didn't have quite as many chickpeas as the recipe originally called for, and it worked perfectly.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;oshuns;5;i thought these were absolutely restaurant quality, and my husband too thought they were delightful. i cant believe anyone thinks they are bland! i made them without turmeric, couldnt find any...used 1t cinnamon and 1/4 t cloves and drained the chickpeas and added a mostly drained can of diced tomatoes. i did use a hand blender to puree about half of it, and i couldnt have been more pleased with the results. it will definitely stay in the rotation. thanks for the recipe.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;octogurl83;2;very bland, even though i tried to tomato/tomato sauce substitutes. this recipe is ok.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;mariam;4;very good. I used home made ginger garlic paste instead of the separate ginger and garlic. Omitted the cilantro at the end, cuz I did not have any. Served with basmati rice, really good! thanks for sharing!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;rampal;2;I guess because I am Indian I am used to eating food with LOTS of flavor I was disappointed with this one. It didn't have enough flavor for me...
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;elizabethlewis;5;I really liked this dish and made it many times. I used more garlic, but that is just personal taste.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;treemom;3;My family did not enjoy this at all. We had a lot of leftover that was not eaten and had to be thrown away.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;mah;5;We love chickpeas and this is just another wonderful way to fix them!! I used ground cloves and cinnamon also w/ good results. I did use some of the liquid from the chickpeas. 1 tsp of cayenne pepper is a bit much. I was sweating while eating this!! (I liked it none the less) Will decrease the amt of cayenne a bit next time. High ratings from my husband, too. He also agreed to decrease amt of pepper!!!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;flyingham;5;Amazing. This was the first time I've tried making curry, but it was very easy and VERY tasty. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used diced tomatoes instead of the chickpea can broth, plus 1 tsp ground cinnamon instead of 2 sticks, and 1/4 tsp ground cloves instead of 6 whole ones. The tomatoes (and the cilantro!) really added to the flavour, but even before I added them, the fragrance of the spices filled up the kitchen. This was a big hit with my housemates and I'll definitely be making it again!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;marigat;5;Wonderful side dish for an Indian-themed dinner! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and drained the chickpeas while adding a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes, undrained. I also used ground cinnamon and ground cloves. Be sure to stir in the cilantro just before serving and to save some to sprinkle on top. The cayenne pepper made it spicy hot but not too much so- be adventurous and leave it in. Indian food has to have a nice bite to it! Serve some raita on the side to cool the palate if needed. Thanks for one of the best ways to cooking chickpeas I've experienced!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;bfrankwithus;5;fabulous side dish. We like spicy but will cut down on cayenne next time.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;annaid;3;I didn't like this much.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;yochi;4;i drained all but a tiny bit of the chickpea juice and used a 1/2 drained can of diced tomatos. that cinn stick was HARD i couldnt even cut it, so i threw one into the mix whole and used a tsp of ground cinnimon. also after i mixed in the beans i started the basmati rice and simmered the dish till the rice was done. everything else was the same (no salt since the chikpeas had salt in them)...came out great! watch out you dont bite into a clove though!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;alexa;5;Yum! Very easy to make, and the results were very good as well. I shared some with my vegetarian neighbors, and they also agreed that it was quite yummy.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;alexis;4;The flavors in this have great potential, but it does need a few changes. I scaled it down to four, and used 1/2 tsp cinnamon (instead of a stick) and 1/4 tsp ground cloves (instead of 3 whole). This turned out to be too much cloves - the entire kitchen was filled with the smell of cloves which sent my boyfriend and me to the other room until we opened a window and let it air out a bit. Also, instead of using the liquid from the can (gross!), I added about 1/4 cup tomato sauce. It still ended up a little bit dry, so I'll probably up that to 1/2 cup next time. But the tomato was a great addition - I highly recommend it. The dish was *really* spicy too, so next time I'll only use 1/4 tsp cayenne (instead of 1/2).
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;markp;4;Pretty good, and so easy. I usually let it simmer for forty minutes to let the flavors blend, and served it over a bit of rice. For reference, 2/3rds a teaspoon of ground cinnamon is about equivalent to one 2-inch cinnamon stick. Also, don't use the enormously large onions you find in some supermarkets -- use normal medium-sized onions (or else you'll have almost as much onion as chickpeas!).
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;cootiesmom;4;This was very good. I made it with the Chicken Mahkani from this site. The only thing I did different was before I added the cilantro I put about half of the recipe into the food processor and processed into a thick puree which I added back to the other half of the recipe and then added the cilantro. This gave it more texture than just whole chick peas. All we were missing was some naan bread! Thanks for the recipe!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;heatherp;4;This recipe is pretty good, but when I was done with it, I didn't feel like it was totally authentic. I added a couple tablespoons of crushed tomatoes & a couple tablespoons of plain yogurt...and a dash of garam masala...that gave it the consistency and flavor I was looking for.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;simongale;5;Really awesome. Cilantro is pretty much key. I used canned chick peas and it turned out rad.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ali;4;"While frying the onions, I added a package of fresh sliced mushrooms that I needed to use up. When the curry was done, I still was not completely satisfied with the ingredients or the flavor, so I threw in a can of diced italian style tomatoes. The tomatoes seemed to add a ton of flavor and color, and ""held"" the beans together better. I served it over brown rice cooked in chicken stock, with naan bread and baby greens as sides. Yummmmy!......."
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;mbuttler;5;I substituted ground cloves for whole, and ground cinnamon for crushed cinnamon sticks. When it was done, it didn't really look like dinner...so I cooked 6 bratwurst sausages, sliced them and added them, along with 2 heads of chopped broccoli, and then simmered, covered, for another 20 minutes - it was a delicious all-in-one meal. Oh, I also drained and rinsed the chickpeas first, and used water instead of the liquid from the can - it is full of salt and preservatives.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;silverstarseed;3;I agree with those who have said that this recipe is spicy, yet bland. I think it needs some sugar in it, I like the ideas that others have about adding apples and raisins, I think that is what this recipe needs. As is, there is too much cayenne and not enough flavor.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jessicaanne;2;We found this recipe to be very bland, which was surprising, given the variety of spices that went into it. My spices are all fresh, so it wasn't because of poor quality spices. To be fair, we didn't put the full amount of cayenne pepper in while cooking, as my 2-year-old was also going to be eating it, but I did put the container on the table and my husband and I added the extra cayenne pepper to our own plates. But this just made it spicier, not more flavorful. I'm disappointed that this wasn't to our liking, especially after all of the good reviews that this recipe received.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;macchick;5;Sooooo Good! Made it last night, it's even better today!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ebsepke;4;I just loved this dish! I added one tbsp of chicken bulion powder to make it a little more savory (which is the way I am used to it at my favorite Indian restaurant) I also cut the cayenne down to 1?2 as tsp because I was serving this to my kids as well. It was a hit! Thank you for this recipe, I will use it again and again!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;meiling206;4;This recipe had a great aroma, color and flavor...BUT..it was a bit too spicy for my taste. I think next time, we'll add just a 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper. We also added a touch of heavy cream and used parsley rather than cilantro. Pretty tasty over a bed of rice. We also served this with Mic's Naan recipe.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ron;4;Wonderfully fragrant dish.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;lindseyj;4;Very very tasty, though very spicy. I still had heartburn when I woke up the next day! Next time we'll go with our gut feeling that 1 tsp is way too much cayenne!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;anitat;5;A very good curry, but could use another ingredient -- chicken, spinach, something to make it a bit less chick pea-ish. I also found it VERY spicy, although that may be because I used good cayenne. If you're a bit of a spice wimp, be sure to have plenty of plain yogurt on hand. Made this with Indian Chapati Bread from this site, which we also loved.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;bcwengerter;4;Next time, ground cinnamon would probably be easier.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;vim;5;love it, love it. this is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;poopersdad;5;Excellent. I didn't have cloves, but other than that it was made to the recipe. Very good! Next time I would use powdered cinammon rather than the cinammon sticks.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;divinec;4;My husband really liked this. I thought it was good- but not great. I don't think it was the recipe, I just really don't like chicpeas. I rinced the peas and added chickenstock. The fresh cilantro was great. Maybe add more garlic.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;kandiyohiv;4;I really liked this recipe as-is. Some people recommended adding tomatoes rather than using the bean broth, but I did not like this version at all.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;pkeleher;3;Wasn't sure how long to cook, so didn't cook long enough. Tasted ok.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;sassathon;5;While I loved this recipe, my boyfriend raved about the flavor but told me he didn't love the consistency of the garbanzos, and would enjoy it more if they were mashed up. Has anyone ever tried softening or mashing the chickpeas in this recipe?
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;stlfaye;5;Wonderful recipe! This was my first attempt at Indian cooking. I did use the ground cinnamon and cloves, as suggested. I also used some ginger-garlic paste that I purchased at an Indo-Pak. grocery store instead of the ginger and garlic. It tasted even better the next day! Great with a salad and brown rice.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;zopooh;4;I really can't rate this recipe as its written because I just used it to see what kind of spices should be used. That said I used 1/2 tsp dried ginger, 1/4 tsp ground cloves, 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon,2 tsp cumin, 1 tsp coriander,1/4 tsp cayenne, 1 tsp turmeric,1/4 tsp curry, 19 oz can of chickpeas drained, a hand full of chopped cilantro, an undrained can of diced tomatoes, 2tsp of thai chili garlic sauce, and a squirt of ketchup (was out of tomato paste) let it simmer until the juice had reduced.......and it was heaven
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;becs;4;Great but I had to double most of the spices.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;vacookie;3;Was a little disappointed in this. It was allright, but not something that we would clamor for again. It tasted a bit flat to us, not sure why.. But added some lemon juice which really helped.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;molle888;4;Fantastic! I served this with basmati rice, Chicken Makhani (from this site) and Raita (also from this site). My first ever attempt at a curry dish, and I must say it wasn't bad!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jillebersdolberg;5;This may be my favorite recipe. I've made it for many people, and I always get compliments on it. It is a keeper!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;lockesmom;4;These taste great, but chomping down on big pieces of cloves or cinnamon is not so fun. I recommned just using ground cloves and ground cinnamon, or going to the trouble of removing the cloves and cinnamon stick pieces yourself. Also, you might want to drain some of the chickpea liquid to make it thicker. But again, tastes great!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;dcgirlygirl;3;A good simple meal! I halved the recipe, didn't use cinnamon because I didn't think that I would like the sweetness, and added a can of diced tomatoes. One thing I did not like was that I had to watch for the cloves...it wasn't pleasant biting into one.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;johndeye;5;Brilliant!! I tried it with the Chapati bread recipe submitted by INSHA87. Why go out when you can eat this good at home!!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;apcooking;4;"It's good. I added some yellow curry powder, which I think improved the taste a lot; made it ""warmer."" I didn't love that this recipe used the chick pea can liquid, as it's so high in sodium, but I think using water instead would make for a much runnier dish. However, because of this, I completely avoided adding any salt, and still found it pretty salty. In my opinion, the recipe ""Cholay"" on this site is better, but this is pretty good. The fresh corriander really makes this."
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;meemeebuluga;5;Fabulous. I love the taste, texture, and ease of preparation. I made this dish first and then prepared a couple others, so it had plenty of time to simmer on the stove and the chickpeas really absorbed the flavor of the spices.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;addie;4;"This is really really good, and even better when you add bite-size raw apple. I prefer a sweet varity; it has a nice contrast to the curry. It gives the texture a nice bit of crunch too. And as I like apples, I put a lot in mine."
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jillzee;5;Awesome recipe, tastes very authentic. I drained chickpeas and used a can of diced tomatoes and halved cayenne pepper as others suggested. Took this to a potluck and received great reviews there! Quick to make. Great all around.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;catsluvr;5;This recipe is excellent. I used a whole chopped jalapeno pepper to kick it up. I also used ground cinammon. I don't like cilantro so I used regular parsley. I also went on the web and found out that the two cans would equal about 2 cups of fresh chickpeas which I found to be better since I like to avoid the sodium in the canned beans. Absolutely delicious and I will make it again and again.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;markcaron;5;Loved it. I took most of the previous suggestions - omitted chickpea can water, added a can of diced tomatoes with juice, used ground cinnamon instead of sticks. Next time I'll add a little more water or tomatos to make it saucier. I also only used 1/4 tsp cayenne.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;yukonwn;4;The recipe is good as is. Its better with a tomato added. Also, if you render the liquid down and thicken it, it makes an incredible sauce.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;mariawolfe;5;This was delicious. I used 1/2 tsp. of ground cinnamon instead of the crushed cinnamon sticks and have added extra vegetables like spinach, sweet potatoes and white potatoes.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;bostonfoodie;4;"Good basic recipe for chickpeas or ""cholay."" You can also top with chopped tomatoes, onions, and green chiles, or diced boiled potatoes. For more flavor, try adding a teaspoon of tamarind pulp or paste and/or a teaspoon of an Indian spice mix called ""chaat masala"" just before finishing. To thicken the sauce, try potato flakes."
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;soaadali;5;Good recipe.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;laura;5;"This is an extremely easy recipe to make. I drained & rinsed the chickpeas however, because their ""liquid"" looks just nasty. It tastes much better on the second day, as the flavors have time to really saturate the food. It's excellent with a dollup of plain yogurt (or sour cream) mixed in!"
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;sola;3;This was good, but felt like it needed something. It was spicy, yet bland, which I'm not sure how that can happen. I didn't have turmeric, but had all the other spices (used 1 tsp of ground cinnamon instead of sticks), including the fresh cilantro. I used just one large onion. I drained most of the liquid from the beans and added a can of diced tomatoes. I served it over brown rice, and it was good, but not something I'd rush to make again. My husband thought he made his portion better by adding barbeque sauce, but I don't know about that!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;beco;5;This was so yummy. We added fried tofo to the mix and it was amazing! I was hesitant to try the recipe since I'm not a huge fan of chick peas, but I have been converted!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;mason204;5;Excellent. I felt like eating a quick, light vegetarian dinner and this was it. I ate it with Jasmine rice and a green salad and enjoyed it very much.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;danaelizabethfellerwilliams;4;I cut the cayenne pepper in half and it had plenty of kick. It was really tasty.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;indriani;5;New favorite food in my house!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;alinapat;5;Excellent dish - it freezes well too.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;lisamorisingh;5;Delicious thank you!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jgnull;5;YUM!! Fast & easy, too!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;gretacompton;5;Oh, all I can say is MMMMM!!! I could eat this stuff every day.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;carimasciangioli;5;Like others, I used ground cloves and cinnamon and it was still great. My 14 year old son is a vegetarian and he makes this dish all the time now.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;paganangel;5;Really tasty...
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;amphoras;4;yummy and spicy!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ginagina;5;This was my first attempt at making anything even remotely Indian. In place of the ginger, cloves, coriander, and turmeric, I added 1 Tbsp. of curry powder. I also added a cup of raisins during the last five minutes of cooking. This came out AMAZING! I will make this again and again!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;akikoono;5;This is easy to make and tastes excellent !!Recently I've been to an Indian grocery shopping and happened to have a variety of spice.(If you live NYC, go 29th street at Lexington. There are some good Indian grocery stores.) I added caraway seed which added even deeper aroma to this dish.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;sizzlemeat;5;i followed this exctly as stated except i used 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon instead of sticks and it turned out wonderfully. amazing, flavorful, aromatic bliss! i will be making this frequently.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;um2002girl;4;This was an excellent recipe...I did make a few modifications: Like a previous reviewer, I drained the chickpeas and added a can of diced tomatoes (this really adds to the flavor, especially if you don't have a lot of the spices on hand like me). I also didn't have cloves, cinnamon, cilantro, or ginger root on hand. I cut out the garlic as well. I did add a tsp of garam masala powder, which you can find at an Indian grocery, and doubled the cumin (my own personal taste). You'll probably have to play with the amount of spices added to suit your tastes. But it's a quick, delicious, and easy recipe. You can modify the recipe quite a bit and it still tastes excellent!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;lakyni;5;This is a great recipe! I added the cinnamon sticks cut in half and removed them before eating, but otherwise followed recipe exactly. Perfect blend of spices. Will double recipe next time.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;abailey22960;5;I love this recipe. I make it at least once a month. Don't worry if you don't have all the ingredients. I have never used the ginger root, cloves, cinnamon, or cilantro and it is still excellent!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;shawnla;2;Made this dish tonight, had all the ingrediants on hand except i used ground cinnamon instead of stick... seems rather lack-luster and tasteless altho this is my first time trying something of this sort of dish.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;mrsf;4;This was a great, quick recipe that I made a few changes to. I drained the chickpeas and added a can of chopped tomatos, instead. It really added to the flavor. Plus, I added more cayanne and cumin. In all, it came out great and tasted just like the curry that is served in an English pub. Yum.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;acb2424;4;This was pretty good. I wish I had made some roti or naan to go with it, the basmati rice left something to be desired. Also, a note to those who have never cooked with cilantro...don't chop the stems up, just the leaves! Like a lot of indian food, it tasted better the next day. Indian food is hard to cook, I think, especially when you try to make it somewhat healthy and not use much fat. I'm trying to recreate dishes from our favorite restaurant, Nirvana (in New Orleans) but I'm not having much luck. I'm beginning to get desperate and may even try cooking with ghee next time -- although I'll have to work out extra hard the next day!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;aspiringchefrita;5;Delicious and I'm rating it five stars with the following changes - for us it was too salty - will cut back on salt and I also added a can of drained diced tomatoes. I ended up boiling it to reduce the amt of liquid. Next time I will add a little less of the juice from the can of beans. Thanks Aminah. Update - we had some leftover and when I went to taste it cold the next day - I couldn't stop eating it. It's good hot but a keeeeeper as a cold salad too!!!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;katefisher;5;Fantastic! My husband is a hardened carnivore, and this was a breathe of fresh air for me, and he loved it as well. Easy to prepare, I served it with Jasmine Rice, baked chicken and steamed veggies. One caveat, if you are sensitive to spicy food, serve some yogurt on the side. THANKS!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;karenthemiltch;5;By far, one of my favourite recipes from AllRecipes so far! I only used ½ tsp of cayenne (thankfully), used 1 tsp of ground cinnamon and added 2 diced tomatoes and a bag of baby spinach. This was so delicious! I served it with basmati rice, and it made a perfect meal. I can hardly wait until lunch tomorrow, so I can finish the leftovers!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;amd;5;"Very good!!! Tasted like indian food at the best restaurants. I used dried chickpeas, and when cooking added 4 medium tomato, spinich and 2 cups water (since beans were drained after cooking and I love a saucier end product) to copy my favorite dish at a restaurant.... it was identical! If adding water I suggest simmering for 25 minutes until sauce thickens. Went well served over basmati rice and the naan recipe submitted by ""mic""."
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;chensu;5;This was really good, and great for leftovers the next day. But I recommend not adding all the cayenne pepper! Half will do, unless you want it reallly spicy!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;ginah1;5;This is really HOT! I served it with Tandoori Chicken and it felt like we were at an Indian restaurant-delicious!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;brianlee;5;Amazing! The two whole onions may look like a lot, but when everything is added, you can't even notice them. Also, when crushing the cinamon sticks, I recommend you crush them *really* well - the pieces don't soften very much, so the smaller, the better.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jskidmoreca;5;This was such a wonderful dish! I would never have thought that I could make something that tasted so much like it came from a restaurant. It was so simple - don't let the list of spices make you think that it is more difficult than it is! I added defrosted & drained chopped leaf spinach at the end with the cilantro. Very tasty and filling over rice! Will make this over and over!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;taylor123;5;So easy, so good! Can't wait to try it with some other vegetables.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jujudiva;5;This is lovely! But, two onions??? I used one and it was the perfect balance. Two seems overpowering. I also let it simmer for about 20 minutes. This blends the flavors and the sauce thickens, especially as it cools. It's so simple! This is one I will master and I will please all my dinner guests from this day forward!!!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;nspence4;3;Had great potential with all of the fragrant and tasty spices. Unfortunately it was especially spicy to the point of excess and was too soupy. Went well with rice though.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;litlelisa1;5;My family loved it! I halved the oil and sprinkled on a tsp or two of ground cinnamon. We ate it in warm pitas and substituted green chutney (recipe on this site) for the cilantro.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;newcook;5;Great recipe, simple to make and wonderful to eat all week for lunch! I cut the cinnamon sticks amount in half on the advice of a reviewer and I still thought it was a bit much, especially when I came upon the crushed pieces of cinammon while eating. Would ground cinammon be a reasonable substitution, and does anyone have a suggestion on how much? Thanks!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;melodiw;5;Delicious - I made it twice this week! I used a little less coriander and cinnamon the second around (2 sticks of crushed cinnamon is VERY strong - one whole stick was sufficient). I also added asafetida, fenugreek and lime juice, which brought out the flavors and definitely enhanced the dish. The cilantro is nice but, if you don't have any on hand, you can still make it - the curry will stand on its own.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;melissah;5;Was delicious even using canned chickpeas, dried cilantro, and omitting the tumeric and coriander, neither of which I happened to have on hand. Try it on a bed of basmati rice alongside chicken tika!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;alipali;5;I've already reviewed this recipe, but it's become such a favourite of mine that I had to review it again. The last time I made it I added a large can of diced tomatoes (drained) and doubled the spices- it was wonderful!! Plus, once you've got all the spices, it's the easiest thing to make! Yum!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;jg;5;This is really tasty and easy to make, but next time I will use less turmeric. My Indian roommate says it tastes authentically Indian.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;maaro;5;Absolutely delicious! I omitted the fresh cilantro but it was still amazing. I will making this often!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;cwiss;5;We really love this recipe. I make a big batch and freeze it with some rice so we can take it for lunches. This is a staple meal in our house! (I haven't got any kids to test it on.)
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;monistout;1;I am a big indian food lover, I have tried so many dishes, and it seems almost impossible for me to find an indian dish that I do not like, until now. I thought that this dish was very poor, I threw it all out while it was still hot. Way too much cilantro for my taste.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;cdp767;5;great recipe. very delicious and fast. i enjoyed it with some jarred indian pickle on the side.
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;laalethea;5;My whole family is hooked on this recipe! Wonderful and easy to make. I have also substituted and added other ingredients such as white beans, carrots, cauliflower and peas. The base is delicious and versatile!
5784e11b-1860-4bae-9ab3-1bcd2985e63e;kuppusamy;5;Very delicious. Indian food does require an aquired taste to mose Americans though. Definately use fresh chickpeas if at all possible. I serve it with naan or roti.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;mkdrobac;5;Delicious. Everyone said it was the best corn
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;peggybullock;4;Good recipe. A good squirt of lemon in the water makes even iffy corn fabulous. I put it all in a pot with cold water, bring it just to a boil then cover the pan. Its perfect. Old Checkered Betty Crocker cookbook recipe.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;madchatr;5;I liked the concept and for most store bought sweet corn this would be a good recipe. But here is a little back story to some of the very best Sweet Corn we've ever eaten. It was developed in a northwestern Illinois county of McHenry and is called Mirai Corn (which is the variety developed by a friend of my father so many years ago. Anyways that farmer told me the most failed problem for cooking sweet corn is over cooking and in front of me shucked an ear and told me to eat it raw and to my surprise it was most delicious. then said best way to cook this corn is to bring a pot of water to boil then turn it off and soak ears in that water for 3 minutes then remover and butter it if you want but says his corn was so good you won't need to. He was so right. The very best sweet corn I've ever eaten and this is coming from the 64 year old son of a wholesale produce distributer for the midwest from the largest produce distribution center in the country.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;crissy;4;Been doing this for 50 years.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;larrybarnes;5;No it is the way i have been doing it for years it is very good.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;trommom;5;I made it exactly as the recipe is written and it is perfect every time! So easy!

7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;michelleb;5;So easy and the corn came out terrific!
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;patty;5;The corn was was tender delicious and sweet
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;ladysemi;5;It was good we add milk butter and the sugar it was awesome I would make this over and over again if I could
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;diva26;5;Simple and easy! Just the way I like it. Husband and kids loved it!
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;cherielytlemoyer;2;I have tried this recipe twice, and both times, the corn was undercooked.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;jajam;5;Easier corn ever!
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;deb;5;My mother loves corn on the cob! Made this and we will probably not cook corn any other way in the future. Very very good! Easy peasy! I had more than 4 ears of corn and added a bit more sugar.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;dawgsnbuckeyes;5;It’s so simple, and truly made the best corn on the cob we’ve ever eaten! This is the only way I’ll cook it from now on!
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;bookbet;5;The suggestion to use a cooler was brilliant. I used small cooler for eight cobs of supermarket corn It was perfectly cooked.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;drewster;1;There's nothing wrong with this recipe except that if the corn is fresh, you don't need to add sugar to the pot, and if you boil the ears for FIVE (5) minutes, they're ready to serve.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;holly;3;It was OK. I didn’t notice that the sugar added any extra flavor.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;pryceagurs;5;Delicious. It’s a very simple easy to do recipe for your most novice skilled cooks.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;lindajo;5;Great easy peasy way to make corn!!
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;rosie0toole;5;Thank you, thank you. Made this tonight, very, very delicious. >^..^
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;suzannepowell;5;yes very good
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;chelsea;1;Corn was not cooked enough. I had to turn up heat and simmer 10 min more
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;faith;5;My family absolutely loved this recipe. I made 14 cobs of corn, and only three were left over. With only four people eating corn, that's pretty impressive. I added some milk to the water, and boiled the corn for about ten minutes, then steeped it. I also used fresh picked corn from a local farm. Best corn I've ever tasted.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;chicken143;5;This came out perfect!
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;lizhorvathcammin;5;This was awesome! The corn I got is in season right now where I live, and cooking it this way was fantastic, it was not tough or waterlogged at all. I'm doing it this way from now on...
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;glendaleebibbero;5;Steeping the corn seemed to work great, however, 25 minutes seemed too long. We steeped it (after it came to a boil again after adding the corn to the water) for 12 minutes. We only had 2 ears of corn so that might have accounted for some of it. I will definitely use this recipe, as amended, again and again. It was sweet and delicious!
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;tracy;5;Just awesome!!
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;erniesmom;4;Made as directed - tasty, moist and sweet.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;basg101;4;Simple and delicious. I like the way you can dump it and forget it, and the sugar brought out the natural sweetness of the corn. Served with butter and salt, and it was fab!
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;katrina;5;So easy
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;heatherbrickner;5;This actually turned out really tasty!!!! Thank you!!!
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;eddybikales;5;What I love about this is how LONG it takes -- seriously. You can plop in the corn cobs then serve an appetizer or soup, and the corn will be ready (without any monitoring) right when you're ready to move to the main course. Perfect for when you are the cook and host with guests.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;lela;5;The corn was an easy recipe to follow. I was curious about steeping the corn for the 25 minutes. However, the corn turned out well. My family loves corn on the cob, so this method earned five stars.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;bethanyrader;4;It was good, but I'd have liked it to be more cooked. I think next time I'll boil it a few minutes before turning off, it was crisp and I like softer corn.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;mountainlovingal;5;"I love this recipe because it is so unforgiving. I boil the water, drop in the corn (I do bring it back to a roaring boil first.) Then, I turn off the heat and cover them up. Make the rest of dinner and when we're ready to eat -- ""bam"" the corn is nice and done. It makes a difference if you don't put in the dab of sugar -- I was surprised. I'm not sure why this combo of chemicals works so well, but it does. Yum!"
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;meoshiap;5;This recipe was so quick and easy. It was delicious. This will be a go to recipe for me

7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;hollihernndez;5;The best corn on the cob I have ever made! I will be making it this way for good from now on. It had the perfect amount of sweet taste and was super delicious. Perfectly cooked.

7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;jessica;5;Easy and good.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;molly;5;Super simple and delicious way to prepare corn. I used this method to cook our first corn of the 2015 season. I will be using it again.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;yaya77;5;Simple and perfect.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;sandiclark;5;It's awesome....just the way it is. I do have a trick from my mom though. Instead of using sugar, add 1/3 cup whole milk to the water, bring to a boil, shut off and let sit for 20-25 minutes. Sweet as sweet can be
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;cl;3;"This is a good fix for ""old"" corn, but there is no need to add sugar to the water when cooking fresh corn. Simply bring water to a boil, add shucked and clean ears, boil for no more than 4 minutes. All you really need to do is heat the corn. Overcooking is what removes the natural sugar."
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;jeanne16;3;Not as good as the microwave method and much more time consuming.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;dee;1;Way overdone. Noone in my family liked it.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;maddi;4;I don't add sugar (if the corn is fresh, it's really not needed). I usually bring water to boil, add the corn, return to just boiling and then turn off the heat and put a lid on the pot. Let steep 10 minutes, and you have fresh, delicious corn that taste as if it just came out of the field. You can use this method on frozen corn on the cob as well. I learned this recipe over 60 years ago from my Mom, a Farmer's Wife.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;jackieesquivel;5;This is a delicious recipe. I do make a few additions. I add to boiling water sugar, milk, butter, salt, and pepper. This a huge hit at family gatherings. Great recipe Great memories.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;duncanoracledba;5;This was very good. My husband did not realize I was following a recipe and added season all but it was super!

7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;martha7;5;Easy!
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;boo22babes;5;Thank you caquilter for such a tasty, great, easy way to fix a summer staple. Followed recipe exactly. DH loved it - he ate 3 ears!! It will be hitting our table as often as corn is on sale this summer.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;gina;5;Love it!!! Love it!!!! Could make this all the time would not change a thing!!!!
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;jack;5;Started using this recipe for my corn and it is delicious! Simple and quick enough to do other tasks as well. I didn't use any sugar but it was still delish. :)
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;faithn;5;Very quick and simple method that I've been using forever. I definitely want to try the milk trick I keep seeing in the reviews next time.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;holidaybaker;5;I had to change this just slightly. I didnt measure the sugar and probably did 1/2 tsp. I probably cooked the corn 5~7 minutes longer and it was just done. Its also best after it cools about 10 minutes or so. I also turned my stove to 3 instead of off. I must admit this corn was quite sweet. Dont know if it was the added sugar or corn itself. I will measure the sugar out next time. Served with salt and a tsp or so of unsalted butter per cob. My husband loved it.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;missdrea;3;This was too overdone for me. There is a similar recipe on here that only cooks for 10 mins that turned out more to our liking.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;baylameltzer;5;Simple and easy way to prepare corn. It works!
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;charlottegonzalez;5;My dad taught me this years ago and has never failed me once! You can even use a lil sugar with canned corn too!
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;gothicgem;5;My choice has always been to use Equal or artificial sweetener or Agave instead of sugar. Just a little bit. I use it to sweeten fried onions and peppers for sausage or steak subs as well! Yum.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;marianne;5;"Haven't tried steeping for 25 minutes but I make ""cooler corn"" when feeding a crowd. Place corn (have used as many as 2 dozen) into clean cooler. Sprinkle about a tablespoon of sugar over; pour boiling water over (you don't need to cover corn, just a gallon or so); close lid and let set until rest of meal is finished (at least an hour). The cooler keeps corn hot and perfectly cooked. Never fail and frees up stove top and grill for the rest of your feast!"
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;lane;5;I have been cooking corn this way for over 30 years. I also add a little bit of milk. Corn always delicious.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;brooklynman;4;add a tablespoon of milk to the water.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;harrywdog;5;I have used this recipe for years, with and without sugar. The corn comes out perfect every time. The bonus is that you can leave it in the water for a long time without overcooking it. It will stay warm if the water is warm, but stop cooking after about 25 minutes. It's nice to not have to pay much attention to one of the ingredients in a meal.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;donnasue;5;I always have used this method to cook corn on cob. have converted several people . LOl this method never fails.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;pj;5;I too have used this method for years. A dear friend with 5 children taught me. It is an excellent way to have perfect corn on the cob. It will hold for at least 25 minutes, can also hold for 45 minutes. It is important to use sugar, Never salt.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;scooterpie;4;I always put my corn in cold water, add about 2 TBSP sugar, bring to a boil, turn heat off and cover, it can sit up to 2 hrs, always comes out so sweet and still crisp...Tried this and was just as good
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;davidinhendersonville;5;"I have done corn this way for years. It is simply wonderful. This works far better than my quick method (below)if the corn is even a little bit old. If you want to prepare more than a few ears the above method is much quicker too. For really fresh corn, this method takes a very short time and is great: Cut the silk end off where the cob ends, force a little water from the tap under the husks, then microwave two ears of corn at ""high"" for perhaps 5 to 7 minutes, allow to rest a few minutes. Then the silks come off really easy, and the corn is excellent. Butter, salt, and pepper to taste and chow down."
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;gotrecipe;5;I have been using this method for years and always produces fresh tasting corn. Something about the sugar brings out the natural sweetness. Thanks, caquiter, for letting others aware of this simple, but tasty method.
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;pattycakes;5;10 STARS!! DA BOMB!! MAKE THIS ASAP!!!
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;paula;5;I love this easy recipe! So good!
7912c16e-6109-4a23-ae45-1be8613b5854;marianne;5;I thought this was going to be way overcooked by leaving it in the water for that long. It was PERFECT! I really liked this, and it was good without any salt or pepper on it----just some butter. Yum! Yum! Thank you, caquilter!
c88fc6f3-462b-41d7-9479-c5c0c0c3122e;buckwheatqueen;5;This works well. I added some vegetable broth. Mine were firm but soft enough to eat at 25 minutes.
c88fc6f3-462b-41d7-9479-c5c0c0c3122e;jen;5;Maybe a minute or two longer on the time.
c88fc6f3-462b-41d7-9479-c5c0c0c3122e;daribailey;5;I made these the same way. They were great. I drained them after they cooled as I was storing them. Do check for rocks in your beans before cooking them though.
c88fc6f3-462b-41d7-9479-c5c0c0c3122e;gaylenmichel;5;Made exactly as directed. Came out soft and was fast just as described. Without soaking first, these were not quite as whole as when you soak. In other words, some were split. Perfectly useable in recipes and salads, etc. After cooked you can spice to your preference. Personally I would add a grind of pink Himalayan salt while cooking to bring out the flavor of the bean a little more so you don’t have to salt them as much at the table. All in all fast alternative to canned beans!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;susanblaski;4;Thought it was terrific. Made a ton for a catering event. Well received.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;cmach;4;I enjoyed this the first night but the leftovers were too garlicky. Next time I will sauté the garlic first. I had one large bunch if kale which made 9 cups so supplemented 3 cups of spinach. I will make again as this is so healthy!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;kar;2;I made this exactly as directed but the lemon was too acidic and the garlic incredibly pungent. You really need to saute the garlic to mellow it out and reduce the lemon juice to balance the flavors. Since all the flavor comes from this dressing, I will not make it again.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;rachelstephens;2;My family loves kale and we usually make a spicy kale salad but we wanted to try something new. This sounded good and had ingredients we like. The lemon juice, however, was overpowering. I questioned the 2 tablespoons of lemon juice as I made it but trusted the recipe. It was so sour that my children and I couldn’t eat more than a bite or two. My husband said he liked it but he also mentioned later that I should have probably trusted my instincts on that one. I would try it again with just a bit of lemon juice and taste it before adding more.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jeanm;4;I only had about half the amount of kale - 'young' kale - and no steamer. So, used half the amounts for the dressing, then tore the leaves into smaller bits, and sauteed over medium heat with a bit of olive oil (just until the leaves were bright green and slightly wilted). Tossed together, and served with cheddar wursts. The teenager said it wasn't bad (which is pretty decent praise from him!). I will probably tweak the balance of the dressing ingredients next time - a bit less lemon juice. Overall a nice side dish!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jasmine;5;Love the brightness of the lemon juice. Didn’t add any extra salt due to the soy sauce already in the recipe. Will definitely make again.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;mloh;5;Perfect recipe as it is! Thanks for sharing
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;joli;5;Easy and delicious
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;lcd;5;I made just a couple of adjustments. I added equal amounts of kale and spinach as that is what I had available. I also cooked the greens I a little chicken broth instead of steaming and added some balsamic vinegar. Delicious.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;heathersavage;4;I like it, my husband loved it. Very easy and the ingredients for the dressing are always on hand.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;rebbesoul;5;This is a winner. Really easy, quick, and every so delicious. Great side dish!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;marinalevin;5;A new favorite to prepare kale. Next time, I’d add a little less garlic and, like one reviewer suggested, lemon zest. Agree with another review that no additional salt is necessary as soy sauce has enough.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;pat;5;We loved this. I have a lot of kale in the garden even at this late date, we have not seen a hard frost yet. Great taste and as a bonus, felt like we were eating very healthy.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jordanmaloney;5;Delicious
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jenn;4;Always looking for ways to eat kale. Sadly this dish didn’t quite measure up. I found it too tart and the kale was still too spikey. This recipe could be improved by doing 2 things differently: Less lemon juice, and Rubbing/massaging the kale leaves before Cooking, to break down the fibers. I saw this in recipes I’ve used in the past, but haven’t cooked kale for a long time. I’ll remember to do that next time.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;babs;4;Love how quick this salad comes together. I added feta cheese and extra lemon juice from fresh lemons. Would add cherry tomatoes next time but I already made a tomato and cucumber salad to serve with this salad.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jan;5;Very delicious and easy way to liven up steamed kale.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;geriwagnermcpeek;5;I hate vegetables but this is delicious! And so easy!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;erinnruss;5;Excellent. I never know what to do with the surplus of kale from my garden. This is an excellent way to use some up
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;mihaela;5;Best kale I’ve made! My teenage kids wanted thirds! And that’s saying a lot! I added chicken broth and a large portobello mushroom cut up. I could eat this every day!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;chris;5;Wonderful! Made it with no changes - a great way to eat more greens!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;floragee;5;So good and only 1 PT on WW!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;keith;5;"Previously, vinegar was my preferred acid for greens; not anymore. Lemon juice is a perfect match with kale. This dish was delicious. I added a pinch of red pepper flakes. It worked."
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;vtwayman1;5;Fantastic!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;pattilebeauchorn;5;Tasted GREAT! It was fast and Easy . I added a little more lemon juice and garlic!!!! I Will definitely be making this all the time!!! LOVE IT
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;godfrey;5;"Favorite Kale recipe! I use 16oz bag of kale and I can eat all by myself at one meal. I use fresh garlic and fresh lemon juice and it tastes much better than minced garlic from a jar and lemon juice form a bottle. So easy to make and even my kids says, ""I don't know why I keep eating this. I normally do not like Kale."". It goes well with any type of dish- American, Chinese, Mexican."
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;arrowsx10;5;used lime juice instead of lemon juice and added a teaspoon of the samekh to the dressing. I also chopped up an apple and tossed it in there. It turned out delicious.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;lorih;4;The dressing for this is great. I sautéed the garlic before I added it. This would go so well on so many other things like seafood, other steamed veggies, salads. I would have gladly given this dish all five stars, but it was.... kale. I don't love it. Sorry, nothing personal, kale.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;traciburger;5;This recipe turned out awesome! My son even ate it (he HATES vegetables). Will make again.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;pinaicook;5;This is another good alternative recipe for my usual Kale veg. I followed exactly the ingredients and it taste great. simple but very nutritious and easy to make.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;tcasa;4;I absolutely loved this method of cooking kale. After making this twice I preferred my own olive oil, balsamic dressing over the dressing/seasoning mentioned. Definitely going to steam kale from now on! Thank you.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;elaine7911;5;great and healthy recipe. will make this again I have been looking for a kale recipe that my husband would eat. this is the one. even people who don't usually eat kale should try this one
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;rkatos;5;Fast and simple. Tastes great! Don't overcook the kale!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;angelashaw;5;It's an odd taste but it gets better the more you have.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;rose;5;I eat a lot kale. This recipe is easy and delightful. I use toscana kale because I grow it but not the curly leaf type.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;mlorin;5;Thanks to this glorious recipe, kale and I will have a future together after all! This is just delicious!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;sockylugo;5;No changes... yes , definitely would make it again!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;genevievesesterhenn;5;The steamed kale has a very different flavor than raw which is delicious with taste the lemon zing of this recipe.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;justme;5;I don't use garlic, but loved it without. Will make it again.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;kimferris;5;My husband and I love this recipe! I use low sodium soy sauce and skip the salt, maybe double the lemon but the ingredients are otherwise the same. We had it for dinner tonight with broiled haddock and garlic toast. It was all ready in 15 minutes!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;lisainks;5;delicious! wow, thank you
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jeannettestutzman;5;This is one of my all time favorite recipes! I make extra dressing and put it on all kinds of steamed veggies but I make kale nearly every day, sometimes combined with other veggies like cauliflower, broccoli, diced kohlrabi, or parsnips. This dressing is great on pan seared asparagus too.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;fnaflove2;5;BEST THING EVER
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;john;5;This gives a nice tangy, lemony flavor to the kale. It is also flexible. You can easily make changes to fit your mood and ingredients on hand.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;delicioussurprise;5;Delicious just as it is! My friends loved it!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;kath;2;You should only steam for max 2 minutes to get the bitterness of the kale out. You don’t want soggy kale for a salad. Also there’s wayyyyy too much sodium. You don’t need to add salt because the soy sauce is full of sodium.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;elisabethwhite;5;simple and tasty!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;carolewallshenry;5;Delicious! Takes kale to a whole new level!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;deborahkgraham;4;use less lemon juice. High Five! You've made it 1 time. Rate and review
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;janieautrey;5;Loved it!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;nuskie1;5;G Made as recipe stated. Steaming kale made it less bitter, yet still crunchyy. Delicious with dressing
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jann;5;Hubby and I really like this kale! And the bonus is its super easy to make! Thank you for our kale favorite!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;charlesgies;5;I prepared the Mediterranean kale night before last according to the recipe, and my wife and I both loved it. We definitely plan to have it again.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;rongoings;5;this is simple to make and very good to eat
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;janettortorelli;5;THis was delicious! A tasty way to eat a superfood. My husband dislikes raw kale but really enjoyed this.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;deewonda;5;I love that I didn't boil my kale to death! Steamed for the full 10-minutes the leaves were still tough in less time. Wonderful flavor and I added crushed red pepper flakes for a little heat. Very tasty!!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;karen;3;As much as I love garlic, I thought 1 Tablespoon was entirely too much. If I make this again, it will be with less garlic.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;maryprochnow;3;My kale seemed too bitter. Maybe get fresher leaves next time.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jacqiuel;4;I followed the directions exactly as presented and it was easy to follow. The kale was tasty and the sauce was great. It was good and did not overpower the kale. The steaming helped to keep the taste. Now that I have a good recipe I will certainly make kale more often!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;cboy;5;best kale recipe I've used to date, this went into our recipe rotation
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;deecee;3;Not the recipe that will make a kale-lover out of you. I have other kale recipes that I make from time to time, but will not repeat this one.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;queenbee;5;I loved it . I will make it again.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;lbrewster;4;I didn't cook my kale quite as long as I should have, but I like having a different recipe for kale other than my Southern style. I liked the taste of this recipe, and it was a nice side dish.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;andromeda;5;Absolutely easy and outstanding!!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;carmonmoen;4;taste really good!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jenn;5;Easy and delicious. I did not change anything.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;brenda;5;I made this for dinner and my husband loved it. We like Kale just about every way it's fixed. I didn't have but about 8 cups instead of 12 so it didn't make much but it was very good. Will make again soon.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;supercooper;5;I made this dish and it was amazing!!! I made it only for myself as a single portion so I adjusted the amount of ingredients used. I added more soy sauce because I LOVE soy sauce!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;loren;5;I chopped 1 Whole Foods bunch of kale which only made ten cups chopped. Used plenty of garlic and olive oil. Cooked the minimum time which left in some crunch. Good stuff!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;brykate;4;Pretty good. Good flavor to put next to steak. I actually ended up mixing sautéed flank steak together with this. That was good!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;tracyw;5;"We've been growing kale for a few years now, and this is our favorite way to make it! The steaming keeps it nice and ""fluffy"" and I love the seasoning. I went rather light on the amounts of the seasoning, just to be careful. You can always add more after tasting. :~)"
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;pammeladenisejackson;5;Turned out great! I added a bit more lemon juice approximately 2.5 tblsp. instead of 2 and no salt. Easy & quick to make and the flavors were paired well!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;dommett;3;I adjusted the receipe for just 2 of us and I found it did not make enough for 2 full servings. The lemon was very strong. I did put the kale directly into boiling chicken broth to wilt it and that seemed to work well. But for me think I would need to adjust the quantity of kale and play with the dressing a bit unless you are really going for that strong lemon flavor.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;missythoensen;4;I made the dressing with no salt and less soy sauce, because I'm watching my sodium intake. It was very good considering it's kale...which can be bitter. Steaming it without over cooking is the key. I will use this recipe again.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;sophiebird;5;This was great. I used a full bag of organic kale already chopped and a little chicken broth to help it steam down. Also added a can of garbanzo beans because we love them. Makes a lot with leftovers for a soup, if any is left. Also didn’t add soy sauce because I didn’t have any, but was still fine.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;patricia;5;I LOVED it ...am in South America until April, and dont usually find fresh kale...made it exactly...WOW! This will be my regular kale recipe...thanks!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;debby;5;Delicious!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;sunnycook;4;I reduced the garlic to 2 teaspoons.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;charles;5;Very tasty way to mow down a whole bunch of kale. Its hard to measure 12 cups of chopped kale but I think I came close and this served the two of us tonight next to a Middle Eastern chicken dish and we have leftovers for one of us. After making it a second time we decided this recipe prescribes a little too much lemon and not enough salt for our tastes. I'll continue adjusting but making it exactly as written is a great start.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;tamaracook;5;I added Roma tomatoes and a small but if white onion for touch more texture, color and bite. Yum!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jazzturtles;5;DELICIOUS!!!! I mixed the olive oil, pepper and garlic and let it sit for a few hour, ahead of time. Can’t wait to make it again!!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;kate;4;I omitted the soy sauce and steamed the kale in the microwave. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. It was very good and a quick side. I'll make it again.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;cookie;4;it's different from when i traditionally make it but, it was still good.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;pearlsamb;5;Super easy, and adds a nice flavor to kale. I have made this several times. I use a healthy bunch of kale, and serve it with either chicken or salmon. If you're avoiding soy, coco aminos is a nice substitute.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;bobbie;5;I made this as is. My husband and I both loved it. I was careful to take out all coarse parts of kale, which kept the kale mild. Will have again soon.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;carmmoscarello;5;The soy sauce is a great addition. I added more garlic which I sliced.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;karenschureman;5;This is just the most wonderful side dish on a weeknight, or even for company. I have made it twice now, and is quickly becoming a family favorite. The only change I made was to make less than the recipe, just adjusting the sauce accordingly. This southern girl loves her greens and the sauce is definitely what makes this dish superb.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;lindabyb;5;I'm not a big kale fan, but loved this. I've made it as is and with some feta thrown in. Liked this just as much.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;lfaccuosti;4;Pretty good if the dressing is sweetened with honey.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;angielipscomb;5;I followed the recipe exactly to the t and loved it. it is delicious.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;pennyemilyyoungreen;3;I love most things kale but this wasn't one of them. I was certain I would like this tremendously, given the list of ingredients but unfortunately, I was unimpressed. It was okay, was all eaten up but not likely to get served here again.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;snehildua;5;Delicious , and quick and easy to make. Loved it, esp as I picked fresh kale from my garden.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;fredthesoupmaker;5;This was very simple to make and delicious also. I will definitely make again.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;rosiedreams;5;Delicious and quick. We aren't typically fans of kale, but this was a nice, light side dish. I will be adding this to my recipe files.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;redlands;3;I like a bit of spicy taste so I added a some red pepper flakes. This recipe was ok.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;robertahenson;5;This was different and my family liked it.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;avidwalker64;5;Made it according to recipe. Delicious! Will definitely make again but will cut back on lemon juice and add an extra soy sauce.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;louisefreemanbradford;5;This nutritious recipe was the best I've had with kale as a side dish. Super easy too! I was very satisfied with the result! Thanks! 5 + stars!!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jacki;5;Do it exactly as written. It's is such a dilicious recipe. I love garlic but others may prefer less. Just started eating kale to lower my cholesterol. So glad I found this one. I thought I would need to purchase a juicer, but after doing more research I found out that steaming the kale was actually more nutrient dense. I am now alternating this same recipe with brocolli. The recipe now rests on my sugar canister. It's a keeper !
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;knome;5;Followed recipe as is then added feta, quinoa & cherry tomatoes.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;formymen;5;I made this as a side dish, not a salad dish. This was absolutely delicious. Since I wanted to keep it warm, I added warm bacon bits. This will be on my dinner rotation. Thank you for submitting.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;tlt122665;5;This is fantastic! I always like to follow the recipe the first time I make something so that I know if the next time I need to make adjustments, but this is wonderful as the recipe is written.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;nhgrammy;5;This was an easy way to get kale in our diet. Very fresh tasting. I used the zest and juice of half a large lemon, along with 2 tsp EVOO, 1 tsp low sodium soy sauce, fresh ground black pepper and one good sized clove of garlic. I omitted the added salt. Family enjoyed this.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;kandiyohiv;4;This was good. I had to steam my kale about 50% longer. I would use half as much sauce and be very careful with the salt. Kale has so many nooks & crannies it hangs onto the sauce really well so it was a bit overpowering. I filled my 2 steamer baskets full of kale (it was probably about half a head) and I'd use half the sauce recipe next time.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;lisar;5;I added crumbled bacon. How can you go wrong with bacon, but I think it would be fine as is !
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;gavin;5;this is fast, easy, healthy and delicious!!! thank you. Gavin
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;marysandlinrowell;5;Loved it. I used lemon olive oil and lemon juice. Very good way to eat kale!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;annac;5;"My son said ""OMG Mom, this kale is amazing"". That's all I needed to hear."
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;tanyalimlong;3;I did not have a steamer so I did it in two batches steaming over a half inch of water. Also, I used lime vs lemon juice given what was in my fridge. The dressing was STRONG when I tried it (but yummy!) and I could have used less salt. Next time I'm taking the time to really mince that garlic better so I don't end up with chunks. I'm looking forward to it cooling down and being able to eat it throughout the week.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;cathigreen;5;A family favorite! When you eat it you feel this boost of energy like nothing else. Must be all those vitamins!!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;ppk;1;All I taste was the lemon.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;mary;4;Great recipe. Added some chopped strawberries with a little sugar.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;sparkleve;4;I added spinach. I like this but maybe had to much garlic. Don't breath on anyone after eating it. HAHA
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;hollygermaine;4;Very easy and good. I don't add any salt and use low sodium soy sauce.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;martinarias;4;very tangy and garlicky... just how I like it
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;karenzohos;5;I made this recipe as stated, and it is, by far, the easiest, best tasting kale recipe I've found. I don't know why I've never tried steaming it before, but now I will not make it any other way. Sautéing kale never seemed to cook it enough to a consistency I liked. Two out of three of my kids loved it, and with veggies, that rarely happens. My 4 year old couldn't get enough. Thank you for a great recipe!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;marbear;3;It tasted a little bit like sauerkraut to me
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;dawnmcguirelouizes;4;Good recipe. Honestly kale is not my choice of greens but I ate these because they were quite tasty.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;student;5;Very yummy and a lot less fuss than making it in a frying pan.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;sasha;4;Cut stems away and massage the kale with a little olive oil. Sub Balsamic vinegar for the soy sauce, and it will taste less salty. Add Parmesan cheese, lemon juice, and a dash of salt at the table.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jessicastrange;5;Best when fresh!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;nikki;5;Delicious. Hubby and I loved it. 1st time steaming. Usually I put it in a pan with a little water and stock cube and seasoning. I was looking for a new way and this was a hit
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;marievallo;5;I finally found a way to eat kale! In the past, anyway that I made it fell flat but this recipe was easy and delicious! I do not have a steamer but I put the kale in the microwave with a little bit of water and covered it for 10 minutes! It was perfect!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;merica;5;Very easy and delicious!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jeffpaleo;5;Tasty. I used light Tamari instead of soy sauce for reduced sodium and it was very good. I steamed for 10 minutes and felt that timing to be good.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jeffroberts;4;Surprisingly good. Had huge amount of leftover kale from another recipe and figured it was a good idea to use it. Very tasty, a little spinach-like which is ok by me. My wife hates cooked spinach and yet loved this.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;carol;3;I cooked it longer than ten minutes as I was using a more mature kale. I've only tried a few recipes for kale, so while my partner and I both found this recipe an acceptable way to get a nutritious food into the diet, I'll be checking other recipes to see if I can find anything we like better.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;catherinegallaway;5;Delicious, healthy dish! Turned out so flavourful - even my husband, who doesn't like cooked kale, thought it was great. Made a couple small changes. Boiled the kale a little first, then sautéed it with the rest of the ingredients. Also, used cooking wine in place of half of the lemon juice and didn't add any salt.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;momkr1;5;Simple, quick, pure.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;tlee;5;Awesome! Third time making it! No changes.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jodiedawnkeough;5;I followed the recipe pretty closely, and it turned out great! I am happy to have a new way to prepare Kale. Thanks!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;wrennwillard;5;DELISH!! I also added feta cheese and fresh cherry tomatoes from the garden. For the dressing I added a little honey to even out the acidity of the lemon.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;melissah;5;I added the juice of one whole lemon and crushed the garlic into the sauce which i made ahead of time so the flavors could marinate. It's a keeper!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;gloria;5;Quick, easy and delicious! I modified the dressing to cut down on the sodium. I eliminated the salt, increased the lemon juice and decreased the soy sauce to about 1/2 tsp. Yummy!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;iluvpastry;1;This was really bad. Soy sauce was off putting.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;moty;5;Has a sharp taste and a little bite. I loved it!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;laurashansey;5;"I have been trying to eat Kale forever. This was actually the best recipe. I add whatever else were having; chicken, fish, other veggies to make a great salad."
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jenrn;4;It's flavorful and light.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;daday;5;Really good! I cooked my kale in chicken broth as some of the others. Accidentally added 1 tbsp of soy instead of 1 tsp, still good! Such a fast and easy way to cook kale!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;cynthia;5;I bought a huge bag of chopped kale at the grocery marked down to $1.50 - so I went on a search how to cook it and found this recipe on my favorite site! This was a very flavorful side dish. When steaming the kale, I added a Knorr's cilantro bullion, and a chicken bullion to the water. As one reviewer recommended, I added cilantro (paste) to the marinade. (I love cilantro with most anything.) The flavors melded nicely and made a delicious dish. This was my first attempt at cooking kale, so I'm very happy with the result. Will definitely make it again. And I've already forwarded the recipe to several friends.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;bluecoach;5;Cut back servings but made it exactly as stated. Great recipe and will be doing again.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;melissa;5;Outstanding. I went to the store to but more kale just so I could eat this again. I'm gonna try less garlic just because I'm not a huge raw garlic fan. Again, outstanding!!!!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;rpollardva;5;I bought a HUGE bag of kale from the market recently and needed some recipes. I tried this last night and it was both simple and quite tasty! Mine cooked down to about 3-4 cups worth of kale in 7 minutes and was just the right consistency. I really liked the tangy dressing and will probably try that on other veggies as well since they were items always found in my cupboard. Wow - cupboard - old much? :)
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;paulwheaton;5;This really surprised me. I have used kale in soups but never tried it as a cooked green. But, since I have an overabundance in my garden I was determined to at least try it. I really like this recipe. I didn't have enough lemon on hand so I substituted for half lemon with lime juice. I topped mine with some homemade pique to give it a little more kick. Yum
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;margabassett;5;Husband and I loved the way this recipe turned out and will keep on our recipe choices .
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;evanmascitti;5;Delicious and SUPER easy!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;vikiliddle;5;I tried this recipe for my first attempt at Kale and it was gorgeous! Excellent taste, definitely recommended!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;cindy;5;I can't stop eating this!! I love it.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;michellemarialombardo;5;Love it!!!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;kristi;5;Delicious, quick, easy and healthy.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;lisaa;5;This was delicious! I usually make kale with a lemon and olive oil dressing when doing a salad but never with steamed kale. I wasn't sure how it would turn out but now I have two great ways to prepare kale. I steamed the kale in the microwave to speed up cooking time.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;erincourtney;5;So good! Used Braggs amino instead of soy sauce bc we are gluten free but it was delicious! Refreshing change from our normal steamed kale side!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;francec;5;Delicious! This is definitely lemony and garlicky, but if you love those two things, you'll love this kale! Very easy to prepare, and I loved the slight hint of soy sauce. I steamed the kale for exactly 10 mins. Kale wilts down quite a bit, so in my opinion, this makes more like 6 servings, not 12. Also, when preparing your kale, remove the rib running down each leaf. It is tough and inedible. This will be a go-to recipe in my house!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;hairwizb;4;This recipe is great! The hint of Lemon and Soy sauce flavored Kale just enough to take out bitterness. Hot or Cold great EATS!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;dianne;5;First time I cooked/ate Kale. Delicious. I will definitely be making this again.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;lesli;5;I made this tonight as our New Year's greens. DH loved it! He said we could make this all year long. My two sons were just okay with it. I used the juice of one lemon. It may have been too much. I will measure more precisely next time, just to see if it can be even better.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jennizan;5;Amazing! I could eat a meal of just this!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;ssserica;5;It's very good definitely will make again. I used lime instead of lemon since I had it at the time still awesome
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;mrslosie;5;Absolutely delicious! This yummy dressing is also wonderful when drizzled over steamed broccolini or spinach!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;dawncornell;4;I thought it was good and will use again. I'm trying to incorporate more greens in our diet. I followed the recipe then threw in some pine nuts, added just a splash of red wine vinegar (something my family always likes on their greens), and ground some fresh parmesan on top. It was a hit. I was going for a Mediterranean type meal and made a quick version of pork scaloppini with mushrooms using some left over pork loin, then topped the meal off with a slice of cheese-jalapeno focaccia bread (store bought). It made it a quick, easy, tasteful meal that wasn't too high in bad fats and carbs. I read some of the negative comments and think some problems may have been with the cooking of the kale itself. I had two large bunches that I steamed in a big pot for a little over 10 minutes, until it was a little soft. I did salt the kale while steaming, but fairly lightly. After it cooked, I drained it, pealed off the leaf portions, tore it up, and threw away the stems. I measured out the ingredients per recipe, and tossed as directed and added the pine nuts. It just slightly coated the big bowl of kale (no liquid left over), and the amount and balance of flavor was just about right to me, but I do like using both garlic and lemon in cooking. I didn't add but a grind of salt to the seasoning mixture the since it already called for soy sauce, but did add several grinds of black pepper. At that point, I tasted it and decided to add the splash of red wine vinegar and parmesan.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;chevy;1;TOO MUCH GARLIC AND KALE WAS BITTER.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;kiwi261;5;I added lemon zest too. Very good.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;kathyerwin8173;5;We loved this recipe. Made extra dressing for salad because we liked it so much. Thanks
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;carolynsmith;5;Excellent! Have made several times! Just as delicious with lime juice!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;myhubbysbender;5;Fantastic! Made this using 1 cup chicken broth as others suggested and it's by far my favorite kale recipe. Use fresh lemon juice. I also added a little more soy sauce because I love the flavor. I mixed the sauce ingredients and added to kale after about five minute of steaming so the garlic would cook just a bit. Plated with chicken tenderloins sautéed in EVOO with garlic and lemon juice, salt, and pepper and it was a perfect under 20 minute dinner from start to finish.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;gabby;5;"I needed a little snack and wanted it to be healthy; So I made this and I loved it!! Tasted good warm an also cold. Deffinetly will make this for lunch on the go !!"
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;cgrubs;5;Delicious! I will for sure make this again.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;southernpessimist;4;I recently had a kale caesar salad at a restaurant which got me thinking about trying to reproduce the flavor in cooked kale. My first attempt was almost exactly this recipe except I used asian fish sauce instead of soy sauce and topped it with cheese.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;4mittens;5;This salad is so flavorful & good! I use fresh lemon juice and sea salt. The recipe is great!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;becky1234;3;"We ate it all, but I probably won't prepare it this way again, it was just too ""sharp"" and lemony to me. I did add Sunflower Seeds and some Feta Cheese to the serving on my plate which cut down on the lemon flavor and gave it more depth of flavor."
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;cindyo;5;Delicious...very fresh tasting. I used Tamari instead of soy sauce because that's what I had on hand.

3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;shelleydima;3;A decent way to prepare kale. We ate this over rice and added some feta cheese.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;pennykniffin;4;Yummy!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jessicay;3;I like the concept a lot, and the first bites were awesome... just got tired of the taste. If it helps to know, I had cooked the kale in some chicken stock.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;realisticchef;5;"Really simple. My husband loved the ""tang"" (the lemon juice)."
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;sandibeach;5;This is wonderful! Fast, easy, and good for you! I add 1 cup of cooked lentils and double the dressing. We love it!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;schnae;5;So tasty! I love garlic so I made sure to add more. I also drizzled with truffle oil. Just tweak recipe to your taste. The general flavours in this recipe will work out great.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;michelle;4;I also add some chicken broth. I like thing like this if it is cooked for me. But my kids wasn't to enthusiastic about it.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;deborahp;5;This was really good! Even my children ate it. This recipe is a keeper!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;gocubsgo;2;I did not care for this dressing. Anything salty on kale just doesn't taste good to me.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;allrecipescommunity;4;Delicious, nice way to serve Kale
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;suebee;5;I make kale in a variety of ways. What I loved about this was just how simple it is. I did not change anything and when I served it my husband said it was his new favourite kale recipe (and I have some goodies). Making it again tonight!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;sherryl;4;Excellent, flavorful, fast way to prepare kale.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;vkarlsbroten;4;I thought this was pretty good and will likely make again. I did substitute home made raspberry vinegar for the lemon juice. I sauted the garlic briefly to mellow the flavor a bit.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;fourpugs;4;It was quite tasty with the melding of different flavors, and for one who doesn't normally eat kale, it was quite memorable and delicious!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;curweng;5;Fantastic! My husband and I are new to kale & I'm so pleased we found this yummy recipe. I don't have a stove top steamer so I used a Tupperware microwave steamer. Worked beautifully!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;speck;3;It was a little strong on lemon and others sauce flavors
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;bjkinville;5;So tasty! A new addition to our meals.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;junebug;5;I loved this!! I try to eat kale regularily because it's so good for you but it's not my favourite veggie. This sauce made it taste so yummy! Normally I saute the kale but the steaming made it tender. My 19 year old daughter loved it too!!!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;kcmv;5;Realizing the heath benefits of kale, I decided that this recipe would be my first. It was great! I bought a large bag of pre-washed and cut kale from the grocery store, which made preparation a breeze. Instead of soy sauce, I added two chopped marinated sun dried tomatoes. Served this alongside pasta with Arrabiatta sauce, some warm Italian bread with seasoned olive oil and a nice bottle of Pinot Noir. :)
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;gabrielle;5;Used Braggs instead of soy. Make sure you chop that garlic up small. Left out additional salt as soy/braggs has plenty for me.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;lavon;5;Wow! I wasn't expecting this recipe to taste so good! Delicious!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jessicawatsongloss;3;Too much vinegar, but ok.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;juliawooters;5;This was my first adventure in preparing kale and it is delicious. Unfortunately for husband, he won't eat it because of the amount of garlic. His loss!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;lizmvr;5;This was easy. I didn't steam the kale on the stovetoop, but in the microwave. I didn't make as much since I was only cooking for myself. I thought the garlic, lemon, and soy sauce was a good combination, and I left the kale in the bit of the liquid that resulted from the steaming. I didn't have straight olive oil, but used a canola/olive oil blend. I didn't add extra salt, but I probably could have used a tiny bit more pepper than the sprinkling I gave mine. I would totally make this again.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;shannonbachorick;5;I loved the flavours of the sauce with the kale! I used bagged baby kale, which shrank down quite a bit, so I cooked and added some frozen spinach to stretch it out. I will use full leaf kale next time, and take a picture!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;ladonna09;3;It came out okay. It's my first time making kale, so it's probably that I have to get use to the taste. It smelled delicious! Maybe next time I'll try it with the chicken stock for a meaty flavor. Overall, it was still good and edible. Thanks.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;funkyapples;4;I liked the idea of adding soy sauce to kale. Next time I won't add salt tough.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jennex;4;Really good. Next time I'll double kale and sauce. Barely made enough for three people. Used half a bag of kale.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;maryp;5;This simply is a great recipe. Zero tweaks needed. Thanks Julia.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;holidaybaker;5;This is delicious, as suggested. I am not that familiar with cooking with kale or the best recipes. So, I decided to make 1/4 of the recipe to try it. Now, I wish I would have made more as I only got 1 small serving! I don't have a steamer, so I put the kale in the microwave and steamed it with 1/2 cup of water. I used a medium sized bowl and covered it with plastic wrap. I cooked it for 10 minutes, on high, stirring once. At 7 minutes, it still had the bright green color but was too crunchy for me in a recipe like this. After 10 minutes it was slightly darker but much softer. I gently drained it and stirred in the rest of the ingredients. It slightly reminded me of collards. ty
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;lizzyline;5;Delicious
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;netzel;5;Great way to prepare kale, thanks for the recipe! The only thing I would adjust is use low sodium soy sauce and I did not add extra salt, it was a little salty for my taste but delicious.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jan;4;My husband made a side dish of sauted sweet peppers, onions and peanuts. We decided to combine the kale dish with the pepper dish. I liked the way the sweet peppers mellowed the kale. The peanut crunch was also good. I used 3 cloves of garlic as I love garlic!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;cbrownkramer;5;Delicious! As other reviewers suggested, I boiled the kale in 1c chicken broth until it shrank down a bit but was still a bit crunchy. I added just half of the lemon juice/olive oil/soy sauce mixture to that--the whole amount would have been way too salty for my tastes. Husband ate it all up making yummy noises!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;judy7905;5;Excellent (and easy)!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;lizcancook;3;We love kale, but this tasted bitter and too lemon-y. I'll stick to adding it to soups and pastas or making chips.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;justjam;5;MMMMM so delicious! i cut the recipe in half since it was going to just be a snack for me.. but wish i would have made the full amount! this is super tasty.. i've had kale chips before and kale in soups.. but never steamed.. i basically followed the recipe.. adding a little more lemon and a little less olive oil.. just wow.. ty so much for this recipe.. cant wait to make more of it and share with bf
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;kgora;4;"I'm always looking for tasty ways to add greens to my diet. Between that and seeing this was categorized as a Myplate recipe I thought I would give this a whirl. I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was. I scaled it to one serving for just me and didn't want to ""crack open"" a fresh lemon for just 1 teaspoon so I subbed raw apple cider vinegar. Followed the rest of the recipe as directed. This was the best kale recipe I've tried to date, besides adding it to my fruit smoothies :)"
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;maryf;5;Absolutely wonderful. This is now my favorite way to fix kale, and I love the healthful added ingredients.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;andrea;5;20 month old loved it, means it must be good!!! It's added to my vege winner file.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jolley900;2;I wan't a huge fan of this but maybe it was just me. I thought the flavors were more Asian than Mediterranean and there was too much liquid for me.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;shell;5;Awesome as is!!!!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;comountainmama;5;This is my absolute FAVORITE way to prepare kale! My kids gobble it up like crazy and there is never any left over. The only change I make it to add only half the amount of lemon juice. It was too powerful the first time I made it! Other than that, it's a winner!!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;kotmatroskin;5;I followed the instructions quite closely, and I have to say I loved the results. We're signed up to CSA so we get kale every once in a while, and beyond tossing it into soups I did not know what to do with it. This is recipe is awesome. I think it's the lemon juice and garlic that make it really work by softening the kale even more and taking away the bitterness. I had very young kale and I followed the cooking time, I believe with older and thicker plants cooking time would need to increased. It should also be great to steam it with white wine and shallots, like one does with mussels. Thanks for such simple and delicious recipe!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;thesnakebite;5;I stirred fried this in a wok with the same ingredients for only a few minutes and it turned out great. So quick, simple and easy!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;sas;5;AWESOME!!! Thank you
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;happynest;5;So easy, so yummy. Thank you for the recipe. I did borrow from a few of the reviews, like adding a bit of lemon zest (I like it lemony) and sautéing the cooked kale with dressing for a few minutes to warm/mellow the garlic. I used low salt soy sauce so I did add the salt, these seasonings seem great to us. I eyeballed the amount of kale since I was only serving my husband and I - - wished we had made a whole batch for the two of us!! This will be a standard in our house.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;abelincoln;3;Not sure about this one. I have never had kale...have wanted to try it as it has been getting so much press lately. I made this as written. I liked, my husband thought it just ok, and the teenage kids didn't care for it at all.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;cookinkay;3;I tried the recipe using chicken broth for steaming. It was alright. It was a little tangy for a warm vegetable in my opinion. Maybe better cold?
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;nello;4;It was quite flavorful and proved to be a wonderful accompaniment to the baked chicken. One criticism of my wife's, with which I heartily agree, is that if you are going to use soy sauce, there is no need for the salt, as the former is loaded with it. I will certainly try this one again, but as I implied, without the salt.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;spanishdona;5;We loved it! I left out the soy sauce, because I thought the salt would be enough. And I added a teaspoon of Garam Masala with the olive oil, garlic and lemon juice. It was a perfect veggie dish, one that I'm sure I'll make again.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jan;5;I absolutely LOVE this recipe- great texture, flavor and very nutritional as well. Thanks for sharing!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;blannie;5;I slightly altered the recipe - I used lime juice because I didn't have lemon. I also thinly sliced 3 big garlic cloves lengthwise (as shown in one of the pictures for this recipe) instead of mincing it. This gave it a nice mellow garlic taste with each bite with a garlic slice. Next time I'll add even more garlic. I forgot the soy sauce - next time I'll try adding that. Using this recipe, I almost ate the whole bunch of kale in one sitting - I had to stop myself!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jfred5;5;I've made this recipe several times and the whole family has loved it each time. It's a great way to brighten up kale and makes a yummy side dish for pork or chicken and is also a quick snack or appetizer.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;suejohnson;5;Yum, Yum! I changed the dressing to include a squirt of dijon mustard, but no soy, and no salt. I did not steam the kale, i tossed it with kalmata olives, cherry tomatoes and a bit of gorgonzola, then added the delicious dressing. It was over the top good
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;amargaret;5;This was a great recipe. I added just a touch of sesame seed oil and it turned out wonderful. This will now be a staple in my household.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;theresa;5;simple, easy, delicious!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;taylorgb;5;Fantastic hot or cold
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;angelicavasquez;5;Delish! Will make again! Works well with lime too!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;kim;5;Oh My! This was awesome. I went to farmer's market today and bought a bunch of fresh young kale. I prepared it as directed, but added 1 tablespoon of Balsamic, only because I love the taste. Delish!!!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;lindseymarkelz;4;Was yummmy. This kale with rice, a nice little meal. It was a bit on the lemon-y side. I would probably try going a little lighter on lemon and a little heavier on soy & garlic next time.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;lfeeley;5;I LOVED these flavors and the chewy texture of the Kale (over limpness of spinach which I also love.) I did not bother to steam, just rinsed it well in a pan, drained it, and left whatever water clung to the leaves to help with cooking. I added about 1/2 cup of vegetable stock instead of water and brought it to a boil, then turned it down a bit and cooked for 7-8 minutes as directed. I stirred a few times. I didn't bother to drain since a lot of the liquid steamed off anyway. I added the dressing to the hot kale in the pan to warm it up and take the edge off the raw garlic. Then I dished it up with a slotted spoon. The flavors were great, the preparation was very easy, and I love discovering a healthy recipe that is so tasty.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;robbie;5;Wow, really enjoyed this dish. It was the first time I cooked kale, and I love how easy this recipe is and that it uses ingredients I have on hand. Can't beat that! I cut it in half for just hubby and me.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;danacampbell;4;The only change I made is to steam the kale in a steamer and then toss it with the mix described. I used very little salt and a good amount of pepper, it was a hit and I have made it repeatedly to great reviews.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;elh30;5;Awesome! This recipe is so easy to make and full of flavor! Other than the kale, most of the ingredients should be on hand in your pantry. I made it for the first time tonight and can foresee myself making it again and again. Actually, the dressing would be delicious over fish as well. The one addition I made (to use up veggies) was a handful of cherry tomatoes at the last minute or two.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;leonthelion;5;I always make this. Don't over-steam the kale or add too much lemon.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;v;4;Hubby loved, I really liked a different way to prepare a very healthy, nutritious veggie.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;patturner;4;I've tried cooking kale before and it was tough and bitter. This is perfect!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;flygirl11;4;Great taste! I added a bit more lemon juice for my own tastes but its a great recipe!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jontyhs;5;This was such a simple and delicious recipe. I used 1 Tbsp of soy sauce and left everything else as written. The entire family loved it.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;cpride;5;I bought Kale and then didn't know what to do with it. This is one of the only recipes I could find and I love it! I make this almost every week and my 2 year old likes it too. I will say, I don't follow the measurements exactly. I make 2-3 servings and I double almost all the ingredients: soy, lemon juice, pepper, garlic. I like a lot of flavor so I'm not sure how it tastes if you just put in 2 tablespoons lemon, etc. But I do love this recipe and I've sent it to others to try as well.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;nancy;4;I really like this recipe. After steaming the kale, I kept it warm while I sauteed the garlic in olive oil and then threw the kale in. I then added the lemon juice and low sodium soy sauce. Once everything was mixed, I just turned off the heat and added red pepper flakes. Will definitely make this again!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;rosemaryfelle;5;Omg! Fantabulous! It doesn't need a thing. For those that are unaware...Just know that the center rib is inedible, So, you must slice it off.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;polarbyte;5;Loved it. Making it for the 2nd time tonight. Will steam it again and toss with rest of ingredients. Also reheats good too for next days lunch.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;barb57;4;Had a huge bunch of kale so I made kale chips and then found this recipe and it turned out pretty good too. I was out of lemons so I had to use limes.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;nativesdgirl;3;This is my first attempt at cooking kale. It wasnt bad, but the lemon juice was way too overpowering. Probably will try a different recipe next time.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jaybadz;5;I love this recipe. It is super simple to make and tastes great.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;iprettymuchlivetoeat;4;This is different, in a good way! I made the exact recipe and thought it was pretty good... but missing something, so I made a second batch and added about 1/4 tsp of extra lemon, a couple dashes of aged balsamic vinegar, and a small squirt of sriracha! I guess I made it more Asian Kale than Mediterranean! I prefer mine, but the original was good too.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;corruptedpeppermint;5;I Looooooooooove this recipe and make it often. Thanks so much for sharing.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;abunassim;5;I added it to white sauce (with Cheddar cheese) and poured them on pasta, and it was incredible. Thanks for sharing.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jem4612;5;Whole family LOVED this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly. This was even good reheated the next day. Can't wait to make this again. I think I will try the dressing on steamed broccoli too.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;lisarandall;5;I had never prepared or eaten Kale. I got some in my bountiful basket and didn't want to waste it. Made this recipe and LOVED it. I'm no longer afraid of Kale lol
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;djgorishornik;1;Wasn't for me...might be for others. :)
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;rosesonata;5;This is a nice, light way to prepare greens. They are great hot or cold. The whole family loves them.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;stimber8;5;Delicious, quick and easy.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;kellyo;4;Wow, way better than I thought when I read the recipe. Trust it.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;denise;5;Delicious!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;rhody;5;What a delicious taste for such a simple recipe. I would like to make this sauce for other vegetables.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;dlprunus;4;Very good...my toddler ate a few bites.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;beeblh;5;Easy and excellent. I didn't know kale could taste so good. Thank you for the recipe.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;nikkicole1029;5;Awesome recipe! Easy to make!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jhfinxy;4;Very tasty over kale. I made a few additions that kicked it up a notch: a handful of chopped cilantro, some sliced radishes for crunch, and a sauteed red pepper. No matter what other veggies you throw in, I urge you to try adding cilantro, it definitely added depth to the flavors!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jami;4;Super simple and flavorful
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;marj;4;I thought this was too bitter. I used Red Russian Kale out of the garden and it's usually mild, but I don't know if steaming it instead of sauteing it brought more bitter taste to it. My husband and I agree that we will move on from this recipe.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;paperchef;5;I wasn't sure what to expect with this recipe, as I haven't ever prepared kale myself, but it was delicious! For any Trader Joe's shoppers out there, I used their bagged kale as well as TJs jarred garlic (about 3/4T) to save time. This one's a winner!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;oolongla;5;absolutely delicious! I made this for my husband and i, and served it over rice. I just eyeballed the ingredients and it tuned out citrussy/tangy/spicy. will definitely be adding this recipe to my usual veggie side dishes:) This was also my time having kale and now I'm a fan!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;tinawinslow;5;This kale recipe is wonderful! It's simple, easy, and nutritious!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;bec;4;I generally dislike kale, but this recipe was pretty good. I did make a minor change. I thought the dressing was too lemony so I added a couple of teaspoons more olive oil. I also had to cook my kale a lot longer. I cooked it for about 20 minutes or so. Not sure if that is typical or not.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;rachelbenge;5;"Just made this, literally eating it now, and its amazing. I wanted to try kale for the first time. With all that talk about it being a ""superfood""...but I didn't know how to make it! This is officially what I am gonna be making (and eating!) for when I buy kale! Thank you so much!"
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;havalyon;5;Absolutely wonderful! I've never had kale before, but now that I know how to cook it, I'll have it regularly. Everyone loved it.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;bramptonmommyof2;4;Made as is and loved it >kids wanted mushrooms, so I threw those in(anything for them to eat it). Loved this dish. Kids ate it and hubby who htes greens had two servings. Will make again.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;yosy;5;This recipe is awesome! I steamed it just enough to still be a little crunchy. This is a definite keeper, we loved the flavors and texture. Thank you for sharing Julia!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;getgoin;5;Absolutely delicious. Never had kale before this. Used baby kale. Will be making it again and again.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;barb;4;It was a little salty for me, even just using the soy sauce. I also found a few sprinkles of Seasoned Rice Vinegar prior to serving add a nice tangy touch of sweetness. I'll use less soy sauce, next time.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;flamingo1012;5;A great, simple recipe. The kale tasted perfect after steaming for 7 minutes. A tasty, healthy side dish when short on time.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;simplybo;5;Yum! Although I added a bit too much lemon but I will definitely be making this again.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;lawdog;5;Awesome recipe! I have made this every week for the last 4 weeks. It is a great side dish and easy to make.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;carol810;5;This is the first time I've liked kale! I had thirds! Thanks for this recipe.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;rivermistchris;5;I adore this recipe. Our winter Florida garden is thriving with kale right now, so I was looking for some different way to use it. This fit the bill perfectly. I took another person's advice and added cabbage to the steamer (bottom of the basket, then kale on top). I halved the recipe because it is just hubby and I, but kept the same amount of dressing. He LOVED it. I LOVED it! This is definitely on my rotation list! Thanks for sharing this!!!!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;dianas;5;What a great way to serve kale! We really enjoyed the lemony dressing. I will use this recipe often. Thanks, Julia!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;newcook;4;Very Good with the chicken brooth as another reviewer recommended.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;bitterquill;1;I tried it once as described, once without the salt and once without the salt but with extra soy sauce and a little bit of red pepper flakes. None of the attempts were well-received. I'll keep using kale in other recipes but this isn't one that I'll repeat.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;cookie101x;5;I'd never even had kale before I tried this recipe and now I make it all the time for my husband and I. I use a mixture of kale and spinach and don't measure out the ingredients, just sort of guess until it smells right. I prefer to take all the stems out of the kale before cooking as they don't seem to soften up very well. So yeah, overall, I love this recipe and it's so easy!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;betseynorland;4;I didn't measure the dressing, just squeezed some fresh lemon and eye-balled it. I thought it was delicious, but my husband felt the lemon was overpowering. I would measure next time.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;recipesgiovis;5;Loved it!! Follow exactly and you cant go wrong. I added a fistfull of raw sunflower seeds and it was delicious!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;heatherlilly;4;good, but next time I think I'll try sauteing the kale in the dressing to get rid of the slight bitter taste of the raw garlic.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;lovetocook;2;I don't know what it was, but this was awful tasting to me. Too bitter and too garlicky??? I don't know, but I only finished it because I didn't want to waste the health benefits of the kale. My husband wouldn't eat more than a couple of bites. :(
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;roni;5;Absolutely loved it! I added a tsp of agave nectar as well and thoroughly enjoyed it.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;nan;5;This was my first try @ cooking Kale. I was looking for a simple tasty & how to cook kale. I was pleasantly surprised with the taste & ease of preparation...quick & simple...I had it as a side dish.....I used my kitchen scissors to cut it instead of chopping....def a keeper!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;kendradarigan;5;I bought a ton of kale and needed to use it before it wilted. This was the perfect recipe and it was great! My fiance, who doesn't like kale, picked at this all night.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jessicamae;5;This was absouloutly wonderful! My husband and I couldn't stop eating it. So simple and so GOOD!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;saracezar;5;Beyond Delish!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;misseswaffles;5;OH my, this was awesome! I did cook the kale in a bit of reduced chicken stock (as another reviewer did). The flavor really makes the kale taste meaty. YUM! I did make one boo boo...I wanted to double the sauce but didn't pay attention to the proportions and I made it a little too garlicky. My fault...but I mentioned this to point out that the proportions are just right as they are!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;bobbiet;5;I don't have a steamer, so I added some chicken stock at the bottom of the pan and brought it to a boil. I threw in the kale and added the sauce after the kale had cooked down a bit. We all thoroughly enjoyed this in my house.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;shayne913;5;I didn't have lemon juice, so I used white balsamic vinegar instead, and it was wonderful!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;samantha715;5;Excellent way to prepare kale. I actually used lime since I had no lemon in the house. It turned out great! It was my roommates 1st kale experience and he really liked it. It reminded us of a pickle. So good! Thanks for sharing.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;koinek;4;I added a bit of fresh chopped red cabbage to add a bit of crunchiness and take away a bit of the bitterness.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;lynn;5;This was excellent! I will definitely make it again, but maybe with a little less garlic.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;jwilson1776;4;Good. Always looking for another way to eat kale.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;shellysteinmetzmcknight;5;This salad is DELICIOUS. At first I was a little skeptical as I was steaming the leaves, I thought it was going to be warm. No the mix of lemon juice, minced garlic and soy give this nutritious green a great flavor. will make this again for sure.
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;mirandapants;5;Very tasty and easy! This will be my go to way to make kale from now on!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;midnightcookies;5;I used the juice of one lemon, plus some zest, 1 clove of garlic grated on my microplane, and no additional salt as the soy sauce has plenty. Very tasty! I will make this again, it's easy and a great way to get more of this supperfood into my diet!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;suzyhomemaker7;5;Delicious!
3a1092ae-0cd8-43a2-949d-1c8d21ac8be0;melanies;4;"I've been looking for more ways to cook kale and think I've come across a keeper ;) I used equal amounts kale and spinach and served it up with brown rice and chicken breast marinated in teriyaki sauce. Very nice. Thanks for sharing!"
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;joannaanselme;5;Loved it! So tender, easy to store in fridge and use all week long for a quick meal!
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;kjo;5;I froze the meat. I thawed it out the night before and wrapped in shells, topped with cheese and put in over at 375 degrees for 35 minutes and covered with foil. Served with sour cream. Excellent.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;willsmomma;5;I would just like to say thank you sometimes you don't realize what something as simple as sharing a recipe can do for someone's life my husband had throat cancer 2 years ago thanks to the Good Lord above the chemo and radiation killed it but the scar is still there so whatever he eats has to be soft and no spicy food what so ever I tried this leaving the pepper out I double batch the sauce n keep the chicken the same cook some of the sauce with the chicken and the rest on top of the stove freeze them in small containers and pull out and defrost what I need throw it in a soft taco shell some sauce under and over a little cheese and you know the rest usually I don't like them but yours are delicious just wanted to thank you it's hard sometimes to find things he can eat but thanks to you I have been able to add one more thing you have made my life easier and his a whole lot tastier always looking but I will surely keep this one in the freezer bless you for sharing
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;marykatherine;5;This was tasty and easy. We used thighs and it still worked well. We like spice so may add more cayenne the next time, it was pretty mild as it was written, but still flavorful.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;margierobinson;4;The chicken was nice and tender but I wasn't overly impressed with the sauce. Definitely convenient, though.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;bre;5;Absolutely love this! When I first put the ingredients together I got nervous because it smelled like tomato soup but I promise you will love it once it’s done cooking! I cannot wait to make this again!
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;sarahlensink;4;I think mine came out 5 stars but would have been 4 if not for these modifications: Add 1 whole small minced onion Add 3 chipotle peppers and adobo sauce Add lime Double cayenne pepper Add smoked paprika. I use fire roasted diced tomatoes I added cheese just before serving and served with black beans
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;tkd377;5;I didn’t make any changes. Slow cooked 4 hours. Dipped in to flour tortillas and topped with Monterey Jack cheese, sour cream & salsa. Whole family loved it. Even the picky eater ( children):)
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;karenbillingsley;5;Very easy and tastes great. The sauce reminds me of the Senoran style of my childhood with a little less heat. Made this dish one night and stored in a covered glass dish in the refrigerator until I had time to make some corn tortillas out of my precious Doña Ripa masa stash that I bring from Costa Rica. Ten chicken enchiladas done and delicious. This recipe is a keeper...love it!
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;allfoodsgj;4;Easy meal that turned out great! I also made the corn salsa recipe and gauc with it!
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;heatherpulley;3;There was too much chili powder in here for me. I did take the advice of others and used a can of Rotel and a can of diced chilis. That's a good call. But all I could really taste was chili powder. To serve, I put a small amount of sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 pan, rolled up 5 enchiladas and then topped with remaining sauce and cheese. Baked at 400 for about 10 minutes to melt the cheese. It was good, just not great!
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;kathymakowskicote;4;This passed the test in our house. Will make again, likely with more cayenne pepper. It's fairly mild, yet still flavorful as written. We wrapped it in soft tacos with cheese and medium salsa. I used an immersion blender at the beginning, then flopped with chicken breast around in the sauce to cover it, then cooked on low about 8 hours. Cleaned up super easy, even without a liner.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;kmay;5;Will definitely add this to my list of favorites! I made enchiladas, street tacos, and served this over beans & rice. Great flavor!
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;mikemike;5;tasted very good very good flavor or should i say muy bueno LOL
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;lynnc;4;This is now my go to enchilada recipe. Only thing i add is sliced onion and bell pepper on top of the chicken. Once cooked I shred the chicken and roll into corn tortillas with the onions, peppers, and some shredded cheese. Then top with remaining sauce, a little more cheese and bake for 20 minutes. So good!
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;megncita;2;Did not like the sauce at all. My husband didnt even like it and he likes everything lol
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;jackieb;5;I made it exactly and I'll tell you i was a little worried about the amount of chili and stuff. But it was perfect.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;callmetopaz;5;So simple to make and absolutely delicious. My family devoured it. This is being added into our regular rotation. Yum!
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;an;5;Used this to make enchiladas, and they were the best we've ever had!
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;coreygrundman;5;going to make it now. i have a can of red sauce whoch i prefer (lol boiling dried red chiles, pure, and straining them takes to long). the chicken sounds very flavorful for the insides and im thinking the broth/ sauce made from this will be awesome to make rice with. ill substitute a can of tomatoes/chiles as well.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;kdblum;5;Great basic recipe but here are some short cuts. Use a package of HOT chili mix as the spices. Add in a can of hot rotel tomatoes. At only 100 calories a serving this recipe rocked! My husband didn't even know it was low calorie and I am using the leftovers to wrap up in lettuce wraps for my low calorie lunch.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;lynncraig;5;This was fabulous! I used chipotle chili powder. The chicken was SO tender! My husband and I don't eat many carbs, so we topped the meat with a little fat-free cheese and a bit of sour cream, very filling! Next time I will try Ancho chili powder.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;jennyroberson;5;Used Rotel instead of reg tomatoes. Great recipe!
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;my3boys;5;I made this super easy recipe and didn't change a thing...loved it! Adding to my favorites. Thank you!!
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;laurgal222;1;Did not like, flavor was way too overpowering with chili powder. Won't make again.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;pammeladenisejackson;5;5 STARS!!! Simply Amazing!!! I was in need of a quick chicken taco enchilada recipe! This is it! It will definitely be my go to from here on out!! It's simple to put together and the crockpot does all the work!!! The entire house was full of this beautiful aroma! I tweaked the recipe a bit for 2. Used 3 chicken breasts, and halved all the other ingredients. I keep a stash of my own homemade taco dry spices I used that and a tsp of dry Chipotle spice. Full of flavor!!! We're having a side salad with this and roasted corn!!! Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!!
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;donderenthal;5;This was super simple and delicious. Everybody from age nine and up loved it. Only change I made was adding a bit of onion powder. Dredged flour tortillas in the sauce, stuffed them with the chicken and cheese and baked until hot. Definitely a staple in our house.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;robertvenegas;5;Kari, I made it, my kids devoured it. My 5 year old that only likes pb&j and Mac & cheese was the first one done. You nailed it. Thanks. This will be a staple in my house now.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;beckysmith;4;The chicken turned out really tender, but next time I will use chicken thighs. They have more flavor.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;goodeatin;5;My family thought this was really good. The only thing I changed was to use tomatoes with green chilis, and I also added a can of black beans so it would stretch further. We just spooned it into flour tortillas, topped with cheese and sour cream. A nice recipe to come home to.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;wrenpow;5;Yum! going to do chicken again and make extra sauce for beef i did use rotel's diced tomatoes instead of regular ones. and shredded chicken with only a little of the sauce then rolled in corn tortillas with the rest of the sauce over the top
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;andrea;5;We loved this meat! We used the meat for tacos, but it would be great in enchiladas or even on nachos. The only changes I made were that I substituted Rotel for the plain tomatoes and used 5 boneless chicken thighs and skipped the cayenne since I had a 2 year old eating them. There was still enough heat to taste good and there was the perfect amount of sauce. I will definitely make again!
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;michaelwagner;5;I made this for myself and my roommate this evening. I followed the recipe exactly but I cooked it on high for 4 hours, shredded the chicken then cooked on low for 2 more. It made great enchiladas. I plan to make it again soon with the addition of green peppers and onions for the filling.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;tootscooks;5;"I've tried making my own enchilada sauce and wound up dumping it. But this is A-One! I just purchased a 4 qt. Crock Pot so was anxious to try this using what was in my pantry and fridge ... so subbed with tomato sauce; 2 cloves garlic; half diced onion; cut salt in half and used half a whole skin-on chicken. In the pot overnight and WOW! Skin and bones slipped off chicken like buttah! There is so much flavor in the bones and dark meat that adds to the sauce and overall flavor of the meat. I thought the half cup of flour would be too much, but it thickens the sauce perfectly without diluting the flavor. Thank you Kari for a delicious resolve to home made enchilada sauce (makes a quart)!"
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;dmacd;3;this was pretty good although my initial taste felt like it was missing something so I added a can of green chilis. I also used spicy red pepper tomatoes for added spice. I might do recipe & a half of sauce and set some aside for laying in the bottom of the pan and on top of the enchiladas for baking.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;cathydodson;4;very yummy on burritos and enchiladas
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;deanna;3;Was good but way to messy to put in a soft shell & eat.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;djc;5;My family and loved it. I omitted the cayenne pepper and added a small onion will be making this for a long time
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;boba;4;Very good. I thought it was a bit salty, so I'll turn it down next time. I also cut the flour a bit. Unused portion goes in tacos tomorrow.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;torimyerleezer;5;Excellent, a big hit with my family! Super easy as recipe title indicates. I used diced tomatoes with jalapeño for a little kick then let chicken marinate in some enchilada sauce overnight.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;kathinabrincefield;5;My family loved this. I didn't have the diced tomatoes so I used tomato sauce since that is what I had. I found using the tomato sauce helped so I didn't have to use the blender and saved me time before I left for work. I also added more cayenne pepper and I use curry powder instead of cumin. My kids are picky and they loved this.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;qianaalimedabyrd;5;The sauce needs a tiny bit more kick, but overall it was amazing!
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;a1i50n;5;SO, so, so easy and DELICIOUS! I make it almost exactly as the recipe calls for, using Better than Bullion Chicken Base for the broth, so use very little added salt (a pinch). I can't believe how fast it comes together and love that it only takes a blender, a couple of measures, and my slow cooker, so there's not a massive clean up at the end. Versatile enough that it can be used for multiple meals, and can be customized to fit the favorite flavor profile of the cook. Forgot to get it started early enough tonight so we're going to experiment with how it comes out using the pressure cooker function of our Breville Fast-Slow Cooker. THANK YOU for sharing, this is my favorite recipe!!
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;sheilalalonde;5;I followed the recipe exactly and everyone loved these! I was worried about the amount of chili powder in this, but I'm glad I didn't alter the recipe! This makes a very good enchilada sauce and filling for chicken enchiladas! I loved the sauce so much I'm going to try using it for ground beef enchiladas, too! Thanks for a great (and easy) recipe, Kari Shifflett!
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;chella;1;Chili powder is all I can taste.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;candeeland;5;Terrific! I used 7 chicken breasts but kept the sauce the same quantity and it was plenty. Used half of this mixture in a layered-style enchilada casserole with flour tortillas, refried beans, cheese---topped with green onion, sour cream and cilantro. Delicious!
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;db;4;Yum! I put my chicken in the crockpot frozen and put a minimal amount of chicken broth (if any) in the mix, I also use canned tomatoes with diced chili's and for a full recipe use 3 cans otherwise there isn't enough sauce. Once everything is cooked I put a little sauce in the bottom of a pan roll up the chicken and some shredded cheese in tortillas and then top with the rest of the sauce and a little more cheese.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;commanderofchaos;5;really easy recipe with NOT too many ingredients. just made it for the 1st time and its a WINNER!
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;gina;5;Followed the recipe, except for using Rotel diced tomatoes and chilies instead of diced tomatoes and it was a hit! Even the kids couldn't get enough. Will definitely be making this again!
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;cooks4forty;5;This was delicious! I am so happy to know how to make enchilada sauce now. I accidentally forgot the cayenne, but it was spicy enough for our mid-west pallets. I did and a can of green chiles. Turned into great enchiladas.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;pjjeffers;5;Really easy and very tasty! Chicken was so tender and enchilada sauce was amazing! I did add green enchilada sauce to the recipe.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;loves2cook;5;My husband and I loved this recipe. Great filling for enchiladas. I used rotel tomatoes and chilis instead of tomatoes as that is what I had at home. I wanted a extra sauce so I used 3 chicken breasts but kept the other ingredients the same as written. After cooking the chicken in the slow cooker, I rolled it in 10-10 inch tortillas, placed them in a casserole dish, poured the additional sauce over top, covered with foil, and baked at 375 for about 40 mins. Next time though I need to remember to save some of the sauce to the side before shredding the chicken and adding it back to the crockpot. We love cumin, probably my favorite spice, so I enjoyed the flavor and did not find it too overwhelming. Will definitely make again.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;samanthalargebacalso;4;It was pretty good, it's even better with a lot of Monterey Jack and mozzarella cheese.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;ladye;4;easy and a lot yummier than canned enchilada sauces! i substituted chili powder with chipotle chili powder and added a can of fire roasted green chilies, 1 large, diced red pepper and a small bag of frozen corn. low for 8 hours really let the flavors develop and the chicken shredded easily. this made about 12 (large) enchiladas, so I had enough leftover to freeze. I think the filling would have frozen nicely, even without wrapping it in tortillas first. good recipe!
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;katiecorson;4;I haVe changed a few things to make it my own and more flavorful. Instead of using the seasoning it calls for I use fajita and taco season packets from mccormicks, and blend a can of campbels chicken tortilla soup with the chicken broth. Makes for a super yummy sauce. I also use the rotel green chili tomatoes instead of the diced tomatoes.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;graham072442;5;I substituted a can of RoTel tomatoes and chilis for the diced tomatoes and added a can (undiluted) of cream of chicken soup and a small can of minced green chilis (drained). Loved it!
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;debbmall;4;I made this even easier and faster by substituting taco seasoning for the spices. It was quite yummy in my enchiladas tonight. Served it to friends and everyone loved it.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;sassyoldlady;5;Yummy! Easy to prep, easy to use. Roll up with some cheese in a tortilla, maybe some refried beans, good to go! Thanks for the recipe.

43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;brooke;4;Giving only 4 stars as the sauce was a little runny and I had to add cornstarch to thicken it up. I decreased the amount of cumin by half (DH doesn't care for the spice). I love recipes like this that give a great base to work with and personalize, as would be easy to do in this case. Thanks!
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;christina;5;I made this last night and my family loved it. It will replace my old enchilada recipe and this is sooo much easier to make. They loved it so much that I will make it again tonight and serve it over rice instead of with corn tortillas.

43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;tammylarson;3;We enjoyed meal but it wasn't our favorite. Rolled up tortilla with meat mixture and melted cheese on top. Not sure if I would make again and will look for another recipe.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;picklejuices;4;This was easy and pretty good, but I think the cumin was a little strong for our taste. It saved well and I used it to make a corn tortilla layered casserole. I added black olives, shredded monterey jack and baked for 30minutes at 350 degrees. Topped with a tiny bit of sour cream and salsa and my husband loved it.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;bohmac;4;A little salty, but very easy!
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;motulip;4;I added garlic salt as it is a preferred flavor. The potatoes cooked up just right.
43cac70d-96ab-42bd-9b20-9a7fd9088895;rontruitt;4;Not bad. The chicken turns out very tender. The sauce is ok but not my favorite. Next I will cook the chicken in green chile sauce. I bet that will be even better.

My old recipe added chopped carrots for the sweetness so I added this and left out the sugar ~ more vegetables I say! I freeze mine and it makes a wonderful addition to spaghetti sauce all winter!
3b229435-7d40-4636-83e8-2c696d820e0e;lisaroseharter;4;Loved this. I think it could use some salt though.
3b229435-7d40-4636-83e8-2c696d820e0e;sondralongbrake;5;It looks and smells great! I used my first crop from my garden. A red pepper because the store didn’t have green, and five cloves of garlic instead of celery. Fresh basil instead of dried, and a teaspoon of sea salt. I didn’t remove the seeds or juice, so I had to cook it a lot longer to let it thicken. It’s more like chunky tomato sauce than stewed tomatoes. Which is kind of what I was looking for. This was my first time doing this. Pretty happy with it!
3b229435-7d40-4636-83e8-2c696d820e0e;tanikawells;5;I made this to thank everyone who has been here for me since I was diagnosed with Cancer
3b229435-7d40-4636-83e8-2c696d820e0e;nancys;4;These stewed tomatoes were delicious. But I made some changes. I did not add sugar. Not necessary with fresh tomatoes! I also added 2 cloves of crushed garlic and 1/4 cup chopped Italian parsley. I used fresh basil instead of dried. I also cooked it longer - more like 30 minutes. Delicious for breakfast with a fried egg on top!
3b229435-7d40-4636-83e8-2c696d820e0e;ljb;4;The only thing I changed was added a T. garlic. I had to cook a long time for the celery and onions to not be crunchy. I will make again but will saute other ingredients in olive oil first and cut back the sugar.

3b229435-7d40-4636-83e8-2c696d820e0e;valerie;3;Meh. It was easy enough to make but not particularly flavourful. I ended up pureeing the rest and putting it in pasta sauce. Next time I will either add some more spices or just keep looking.
3b229435-7d40-4636-83e8-2c696d820e0e;vicki;5;Great recipe! I used fresh tomatoes and peppers from the garden. I also used fresh basil (2 tablespoons) instead of dried. In addition, I added a tablespoon of fresh oregano.

3b229435-7d40-4636-83e8-2c696d820e0e;luannechavez;5;For those of you who have canned this recipe, did you add lemon juice before canning? I'm kind of a newbie to canning and I've never done tomatoes before. But everything I've read says you have to add some acid, most call for lemon juice, to keep the acid level high enough. Any advice would be appreciated!
3b229435-7d40-4636-83e8-2c696d820e0e;denisesmart;5;"I'm a fan of slow cooking; I had 4 pounds of past-prime, wrinkled grape tomatoes and thought this recipe might work with a slow cooker. I wasn't disappointed! I didn't have celery, so I didn't use it. I added one chopped raw onion. I also added Italian seasoning and garlic, as some other reviewers did. I didn't peel the tomatoes, but I cooked them as-is, on low heat, overnight. It was so good, in fact, that I'm going to make it again, this time with Roma and beefsteak tomatoes. It tasted delicious when I combined it with our rice-cooker rice ""mixture"" that I made (1/2 cup rice, 1/2 cup spelt, 1/2 cup quinoa, 1/2 cup barley, 1/2 cup millet, 1/2 cup chopped onion). Great recipe!"
3b229435-7d40-4636-83e8-2c696d820e0e;meercat74;5;This is an awesome recipe - I used it in my chili recipe and it was a homerun with my hubby. He said he could taste the freshness of the sauce. I made the following changes: I used roma tomatoes(it was what I had on hand), I sauteed fresh minced garlic and added to the other ingredients, I used honey versus sugar (for dietary reasons)and I added to the seasoning oregano, rosemary and an italian medley blend. I will be using this recipe for all my future chili dishes and any others that call for stewed tomatoes. Thanks again!

I followed the recipe to a t with the exception of the basil and mixed it with 2 cans of petite diced tomatos that I had in the pantry rather than fresh. I thought they were better than canned stewed (better fresher flavor even though I didn't go the fresh route) not as good as"" garden fresh"" but in a pinch works very well with what you have!"

3b229435-7d40-4636-83e8-2c696d820e0e;recipesneedgluten;5;I made some of this recipe and canned it, very tasty. A tip I learned is to chop up the tomatoes and let them sit in a colander or big pot overnight or at least a few hours. The juice will seperate from the toms. The juice will then seperte like fat from stock. The top will be a bright red tomato sauce, the bottom is tomato water. Use the top sauce to cook the toms and discard the water or use it to cook rice, add to soup, make bread. It will last in the firidge for several days. The toms will cook down and thicken in half the time and less chance of scorching the pot
3b229435-7d40-4636-83e8-2c696d820e0e;retired;5;This was a most delicious dish. I devided the recipe in half since I was only cooking for my husband and myself. I used our home grown tomatoes and cilantro instead of basil. Added a pinch of salt and a couple shakes of our home grown dried serrano peppers. Deleted the sugar altogether because our tomatoes which are Early Girls have enough of their own sugar. Yummy, we had this dish with stuffed peppers, corn on the cob and sauted mushrooms. Go for it please. We both gave this dish an A++. Will make again, and again. Next time I'll try it with basil, but love my cilantro.
3b229435-7d40-4636-83e8-2c696d820e0e;helene;5;"Made this recipe from about 40 roma tomatoes that a friend gave me. Instead of cooking this with celery and onion, I roasted the tomatoes at 300 for about 1 hour, just drizzled some olive oil, garlic and one medium sized green pepper. I put the entire mixture into my crock pot on low for about 4 hours; I added about 2 tbls of tomato paste. The sauce thickened nicely and my husband asked me if I would make some meat sauce out of it. I browned an onion and about 1 cup of sliced portabello mushrooms in olive oil; I also browned 1 lb. of ground buffalo meat and seasoned with a small amount of salt and ground black pepper and 2 tbls of Agave. My husband has some health issues and I can't use salt and sugar, so I substitute all the time. I've used buffalo many times before and it has a sweeter flavor than beef and is also much healthier. It has a better texture than ground turkey. I moved the tomato mixture from the crock pot to the big stew pot on the top of the stove and warmed them up for about 20 minutes. Served it over penne and made steamed broccoli as a side dish. We loved our dinner and I have two more frozen. It was a good recipe and I appreciate it."

3b229435-7d40-4636-83e8-2c696d820e0e;ctrteresa;4;"What attracted me to this recipe was the fact that it had no salt. I had read the reviews and noticed some said the end product was too watery. So, when I followed the instructions, the only change I made was straining the tomatoes and only using 2 cups of the juice. (I drank the rest. Refreshing.) It still turned out a bit watery, but that's fine. Once the jars cooled, I had to open one and try it. It was a bit bland (sweet maybe?). That was a bit surprising to me since I don't cook with salt. I added a tiny bit of sea salt and that made the difference. The next time I make this, I will reduce the sugar to 2 tsp and add 1 tsp sea salt. I think that will balance it better for my particular taste. The tomatoes are not squashy; they've managed to maintain a bit of firmness and the other veggies still have some crunch to them. All in all, this is very good. It is attractive to the eye, has an excellent texture, and very nice flavor. It was my first time ever canning, so I was afraid I'd mess it up. However, it was a positive experience. There was no specific processing time given, so I did a 15 min. water bath. I'm eating my second bowl of Italian Stewed Tomatoes right now. I was wondering if they taste better with age, after they've sat awhile and the flavors have blended. However, I don't think they'll last long enough to ""age."""

82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;natalieshufelt;4;I altered this recipe. It was a bit bland for us so I added some coconut milk and sriracha. Gave it the creamy texture that we love and also the sweet/spicy flavor. Yum!
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;nanciemartin;4;I thought this was good could have used a little more flavor for me but I did add coconut milk and 1 1/2 c of vegetable broth omitted the can of tomatoes and used all fresh veggies, zucchini, greern bean, corn, peas and butternut squash. I served over brown rice.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;andreamarroquinsandoval;4;Me gustó bastante porque incluye vegatales y los niños ni se dan cuenta de que los están comiendo
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;mlizon;3;Pretty good, but not amazing compared to other Indian dishes I've tried.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;jj2786;2;This was a very odd recipe. I thought the tomatoes in curry was a very strange taste. The diced tomatoes AND tomato paste are entirely too much. I would omit the diced tomatoes and add coconut milk instead, and half the tomato paste
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;essexxx;5;I made this twice. Once according to the recipe and once where I replaced the water with 3/4 of a can of coconut milk. Both times I used fresh vegetables instead of frozen and cut the boullion in half. It's truly great both ways. VERY easy to prepare, quick to cook, and makes great leftovers. I'll be making this a lot more often.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;uhrdavid;4;With a few tweaks, this is a really nice, really easy recipe for a tasty curry. I substituted the water for coconut milk, added a tablespoon of Sri Racha, used 3 TSP of curry powder, and used 7 cloves of garlic, rather than the 2 called for. I pan seared some tofu and used fresh broccoli in addition to frozen mixed veggies. It's a little on the tomatoey side, but it's a nice beginner recipe.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;meredith;5;Especially good when you switch out some of the water for coconut milk!
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;slberres;3;Made this recipe with a bag of frozen Normandy blend style veggies. I did not have tomato paste or fresh garlic on hand, so I used 1/4 tsp garlic powder/clove and omitted the tomato paste. I used chicken bouillon rather than vegetable and 1 tsp dried cilantro instead of fresh as that was on hand. It smelled delicious as it was cooking--in my crock pot, and I was so looking forward to eating it. However, this was a big disappointment all the way around. I served it over rice and the whole dish was rather blah. It was edible and OK. Just not awesome. My husband and kids said the same thing, and if they were picky eaters, I doubt they would have touched it. Sorry, but I doubt I will make again.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;dangie;5;I always add more curry and cumin to spice it up more. Very flavorful.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;heatherbianchi;5;I used fresh veg, diced turnip, carrot, sweet potato, green beans and ordinary potatoes. It was so delicious! Ill definitely make this again and again! Also, it can be blended into a spreading pâté! Thank you! Heather Bianchi
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;zeldasayre;5;Wow. I made a few changes, but didn't expect this to be so good! I used green onions instead of white (I know they aren't the same, but I was out of white onions so I had to improvise), and used a can of light coconut milk instead of water - mostly because I was serving this as a main dish, and I didn't think 108 calories was enough for dinner. Amazing - almost reminded me of tikka masala, but slightly less sweet. And so easy! Really good, highly recommended! I'm not sure I would like it as much without the coconut milk, but this way it definitely deserves five stars.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;marktiberi;2;Flavorful...but not good. The flavors were primary and not blended. I even added coconut milk and red pepper flakes but it was similar to Eating curry powder dusted over tomato... No third dimension to the flavors, just separate and somewhat competing. You keep eating but never really get rewarded.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;dancov;5;Very good and simple to make. I took a few suggestions from othe reviews. I added coconut milk, potatoes, and used less tomatoes. Came out excellent. Served over couscous.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;judilee;5;family loved it. I used fresh cauliflower and carrots. Added 1 can of cocoanut milk. Well make again.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;jsanford;5;This was a flavorful, satisfying, quick and easy meal. I added two diced jalapenos for some heat and served with Greek yogurt. I also used homemade vegetable stock instead of bouillon and water. I honestly don't think I would have rated it highly had I not. I froze the leftovers in individual portions for quick weeknight meals.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;kris;4;Good curry recipe. Highly recommend adding hot curry paste, garam masala, and about a 1/2 a can of coconut milk. Before the addition of these I found the recipe a bit bland and it didn't taste enough like curry to me with only the powder.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;emilybryant;2;Its tasty but it tastes more like my chili rather than curry. And I put probably 5 tablespoons of curry powder in and used a can of coconut milk.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;gg82;4;I added a can of lite coconut milk and more freshly ground pepper. It was very tasty!
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;missprissy1;3;This recipe is really modifiable which is fab. I added an extra tablespoon and a half of curry powder, added about a teaspoon of fresh ginger, half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper (makes it extra spicy!) and pinch of thyme (yes, thyme) and white pepper. I didn't have tomato paste I left that out and it still tasted great.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;sarahlizzy;5;As a student with a low budget and less time, I need things that are healthy, cheap and fast--and this fit the bill perfectly. I used 1/3 can condensed tomato soup instead of tomatoes & tomato paste, and it came out perfect. I aslo sauteed some squash with the onions which complemented the vegetables and was healthier than adding potatoes.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;pattyward555;1;Not good:(
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;julieannwhite;5;This was 45 minutes faster than the traditional recipe I usually use... and easier, considering I didn't have to go to the store for fresh veggies. I followed it closely, but not precisely. I am grateful for the inspiration to vary the regular recipe I use to save on time!
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;ptulip;5;I have to say the base is excellent, went to my freezer and found left over vegetables from the garden harvest, used green beans, red potatoes, in the refrigerator I had mushroom, broccoli, added coconut milk, ginger, and vegetable stock, I will be making a again. Thank you
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;andrewnelson;5;I listened to some of the reviews and made a few changes myself. I used coconut milk instead of water, used frozen cauliflower, broccoli and carrots, an onion, zucchini, and some red pepper. I used the same amount of Curry as the recipe suggested, and I thought it was great. Oh and I too skipped the 1st step and just simmered everything in a pot, but with these modifications it was absolutely delicious! Thank you for the easy recipe! **UPDATE** I made this again following the original recipe more closely, only change I made was I didn't have tomato paste so instead of curry powder I used red curry paste to accommodate... I found it just as tasty, maybe better because when I use the coconut milk that seems to dominate the flavor. Thanks again for the wonderful recipe! It has definitely entered the permanent rotation!
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;billyjohnson;5;Super Awesome Taste. Thank you reviewer Amee!! tried your custom version but used buttermilk in place of coconut milk , added celery to the curry paste, added yellow squash to the fresh veggie mix. WHAT COLORS AND TASTE! Leftovers were even better. Thank you Mai and Amee. I will keep this recipe lock away and bust out for parties.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;william;5;Add broccoli.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;kathryn;4;I rated this 4 stars because I think it's a great way to make easy, quick accessible curry, and with no meat! Have made it multiple times, and love how spicy it is!
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;marym;3;I adore Indian food and am always trying out new recipes. Firstly, it was quite tomatoey and would suggest a can of tomato sauce instead of paste. I used fresh cut up veggies, used hot madras curry paste instead of curry powder, added cumin, mustard seed, garam masala, a bit of sugar, and vegetable broth instead of cubes. I also threw in a can of chickpeas for some iron. Not a bad recipe, just needed to be expanded upon.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;cpickle;2;Very bland. Tomato is overpowering. Does NOT taste like any curry (good or bad) that I've ever had before. It is easy though.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;aarony;3;I followed the recipe nearly exactly (changed the vegetables), and here's what I have to say: It wasn't so much a curry as a sauce of sorts.. With big vegetables inside. It had the curry flavor (and spice), but it was mostly vegetables for me. I'd recommend using less vegetables, and using fresh ones instead of frozen ones.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;aprilardlouviere;4;I am a fan! This was really yummy and easy to make. My husband complimented it as well. I did add some hot chili sauce to it at the table because I like a little heat. Love the flavor of curry....
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;creampuff;5;Delicious. Spicy, and full of goodness - I felt so fortified eating this. By the way, any veggies you have on hand will do - this is a great way to get rid of those last little bits of veggies hanging out in the cooler box - just cut them up and toss them in. Thanks! We'll definitely be having this again.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;cookingkat;5;Very yummy and the title is perfect!
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;cookingkat;5;Very yummy and the title is perfect!
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;soopermommy;4;This was a good BASE recipe. I used 2 tsp of green curry paste, 1/2 can of lite coconut milk, and 1/2 cup chicken broth. The rest of the recipe was the same for me in addition to using 2 medium potatoes (steamed before adding to curry). I left out the tomato paste and did not find it missing anything.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;ccahoon;5;Easy and really tasty!
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;laurahall;4;This was such a great base recipe. I made a few alterations - used 1 1/2 c chicken broth (what I had on hand), 1 can coconut milk. Instead of the frozen veggies, I used the onion and garlic but then added 1/2c chopped red pepper and about 3/4c whole grape tomatoes. I then added 1 can chickpeas plus about 3/4c peas. I added a wee bit of sugar to mellow the spice a little - might cut the curry to 2T next time so my little ones can try, but still delicious. Served with basmati rice and homemade naan - to die for. Thank you!!
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;dianas;5;My family loved this. I served it with couscous and Baked Tofu bites (from this site). As far as changes, I left out the tomatoes and bouillon cube and used vegetable stock from a box (about 3/4C.) for the liquid. This is definitely easy to make. A great weeknight dinner.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;kckern;4;I tried a variation today, and it wasn't bad at all! I'll have it again sometime!
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;vwbug7;5;I am giving this 5 stars because it lives up to its title...it is quick, it is easy, and it's a great base for a curry dish, without being too intricate, as so many Indian recipes are. I added tofu along with mixed frozen vegetables, left out the tomato paste, and added about two tablespoons of butter during the last 5 minutes of simmering. The butter really gave it a smooth consistency, thickened the sauce, and added even more flavor. I used Indian curry powder (rather than Chinese curry)-- half basic curry (more tumeric based) and half masala curry, and I added three cubes of frozen cilantro. I simmered it for about 45 minutes, until the tomatoes reduced down and were no longer chunky. At the very end, I added a pinch of cinnamon, and it really tied the dish together. Overall, a very good basic curry! I would like to try this with garabanzo beans next.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;yvetteski;4;This is a good starting point for customizing the curry to your taste. I added fresh ginger and additional turmeric, mustard seeds, cumin and a dash of cayenne. For the vegetables I used half a bag of frozen mixed and added a stalk of chopped broccoli ( Next time I would use cauliflower and mushrooms. Instead of vegetable broth I used light coconut milk and a bit of water. When tasting before serving I thought it a little thin so I stirred in some natural, no sugar peanut butter. The peanut butter added nice body and richness without a too pronounced peanut flavor.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;lucy;4;It's a great base to work on, but here's some suggestions for a richer Indian flavor. Add a teaspoon of Garam Masala, and half a teaspoon of chili powder. Then if you want a bit more heat, add one diced pepper to the herbs, garlic and paste (I just used a few slices of jalapeno I had in the fridge).
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;amee;5;I took the suggestion of another review and added the can of Coconut milk and only about 1 and 1/2 cups of chicken broth. It took on a creamy consistency that was so fragrant and tasted amazing! I didn't think it need much more in spice after the curry powder (on our travels a few years ago I had a Turkish Curry I picked up at a local market and I think it was already a little spicier than a normal curry). I also used all fresh veggies in this order: 1 lg. carrot and 1/4 a head of Cauliflower, 2 fresh tomatoes and some chicken I had already cooked before hand. Those were added to the onion/garlic/curry tomato paste, broth and milk concoction. Let those simmer for about 20-25 min. Then I added nice large chunks of Zucchini, Mushrooms and the bell pepper and let those simmer for 15 min. or more (test to make sure they are not overdone along the way). I will try next time to top it off with the cilantro but didn't have any. I definately recommend something for a crunch . . .cashews were another suggestion I took. The salty sweet and spicy was perfect combo. I will be hanging on to this to make again and again.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;alison;4;Delish! This was my first attempt at a curry, and this was the only recipe i found that i had ingredients on hand for. I added a can of red beans, and used tomato sauce instead, and it came out beautifully! YUM!
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;starvibe;5;This was AWESOME!!! I added one chicken breast cut up into chunks. My husband and I couldn't get enough of it!!!
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;kellygriffin;4;This is a pretty good recipe with a few tweaks. First, I halved the oil and used butter for the other half ( not as healthy, but adds authentic flavour to Indian recipe). Next, I added some fresh ginger for added spice. Then to get a bit spicier, I added two generous pinches of chilli powder (Indian chilli, not the American kind you use in chilli con carne).
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;lakeview;5;Another hit at our house! Any meal that I can get all 7 of us to eat without a fuss, is a hit in my book. We used fresh vegetables, not frozen and added some pan-fried tofu and served the mixture over rice, to make a complete meal of it. The kids liked it so much, they asked for it again tonight!
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;jade1977;2;Easy to make, but other simple curry tasted better. will not make this one again.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;jp;5;This is an excellent recipe! I used fresh vegetables instead of frozen ones: broccoli, okra, potato, carrot, yellow bell pepper and zucchini. Mango chutney on the side and a salad. I also added a little coconut milk. Recommended!
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;lemurone;2;Pretty bland.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;jessicaum;5;This was so easy and so good! I didn't have tomato paste so I added some butter as suggested, it turned out great. Only added maybe 2 tbsp. of curry powder. Served with brown rice cooked in my rice cooker!
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;faeriecat;5;Super yummy! Had an awesome savory kick to it and was indeed easy to make. We all got a good curry high from eating it. I used fresh veggies, including parsnips and potatoes, so it took me a bit longer than 30 mins to cook, but the extra time was very worth it. My family and I much enjoyed this recipe and I will definitely make it again.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;erin;5;really easy
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;juliecc;5;Wow, this is so good! It made my house smell yummy for three days! My husband loved it, and he typically dislikes mixed vegetables. I used a green/white bean and carrot mixture. I made some other changes due to preferences and needs (additives). I didn't use diced tomatoes, but rather one, 8-ounce can of tomato sauce. I can't have bouillon cubes, so I used one 8-ounce container of pre-made beef broth. Due to those two changes, I didn't add any water. Yummy! Thank you for the quick and easy way to spice up veggies!
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;miked;3;"**USE FRESH INGREDIENTS** I made it twice, once with frozen veggies and curry powder; once with fresh veggies and curry paste. It made a big difference."
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;debbielopez;2;Was very disappointed. The only flavor that stood out was the curry.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;sophia;4;Deeeeeeeelicous! I only gave it four stars because I added apple, potatoe and mushroom. And next time I will definitely use fresh ingredients, the frozen vegetables didn't quite taste as good (but we are spoiled that way). Thanks for the great recipe, it really tastes wonderful!
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;mattie;4;The quality of this recipe will vary somewhat depending on the freshness of the ingredients. Even so, I used all frozen and canned ingredients and this dish still tasted great. I think it would be a 5 star recipe with fresh stuff.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;ginger;5;Exactly as described- quick and easy! I doubled the sauce and used a 15 oz.can of light coconut milk instead of water. I threw in a fresh bag of veggies and some baked tofu- excellent w/jasmine rice! thanks
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;karen325;3;THIS WAS NOT A FAVORITE RECIPE. THE CURRY POWDER WAS JUST TOO MUCH FOR ME. SORRY BUT NOT A KEEPER.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;rmcooper;5;Really good!
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;enigmachinegun;2;Meh. It was okay. I won't make it again though. My house stunk like curry for a week. I didn't think it was anything special.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;aurora625;5;This was pretty good, I added some hot sauce to it for some extra spice
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;jeffreybehrends;5;This is a fabulous and simple curry. I think I make this at least once every couple weeks. Of course, with any curry, the higher the quality of your curry mix, the better your results will be.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;roborg;4;I kept trying this recipe, and it kept coming out a little bland and bitter, which may have been partly because I never got any cilantro. I'm also not sure why you're supposed to put the tomato paste and curry powder in the pan before the water, it just burned and stuck to the pan, so I started adding it with the water. But this time I added a little more sugar and used fresh tomatoes instead of canned for the bitterness, and used 1/2 cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of water, and it came out great. For the veggies I used broccoli normandy and spinach, great combo. The cream adds about 400 calories to the batch, but it's worth it. Thanks for the great vegetarian recipe!
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;melissaknecht;1;It seriously tasted like vegetable soup on top of rice...even added extra curry and spices and still didn't help. Not worth wasting half an hour of cooking...
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;acovey;5;This was amazing! It had such a rich flavor, and was so filling. Like others suggested, I added potatoes and pecans, which made it much better. I made this for my parents and my dad, who is a very picky eater, couldn't stop raving about it and went back for thirds! I'm definitely going to make this again and again!!!
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;knangreave;5;THIS WAS DELISH! I didn't have any tomato paste, so i just used a few teaspoons of butter instead (1 and a half, I believe) Also, I added about 2 tsps of powdered ginger as well. I absolutely loved this recipe and will make it again without a doubt.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;carolinec;5;This is a really easy recipe to modify. I add fresh cauliflower, okra and zucchini, as well as potato. It's also really yummy if you throw in a handful of split cashew nuts about 5 mins before you are going to serve it (for extra crunchiness, dry fry them in a pan for a few minutes).
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;ourallercook;5;"This was delicious and satisfying. I tried adding the potatoes, as suggested by another reviewer; also added chopped apples. Both additions worked nicely. The trick, I think, is being sure to simmer long enough so that everything gets nice and mushy and all the flavors blend together. Will definitely make this dish again!"
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;diddumdaddum;5;This is really good. It has become one of our regular dinners.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;tracycurtis;3;This was a strange receipe. I really didn't care for it. It reminded me of a tomato receipe which isn't what I wanted to curry. I wouldn't make this again.
82ba33cd-99b7-4afa-9fea-9da0275c9eee;ferrell42;5;I love this rendition!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;bridgetsorensen;5;Easy and tasty! I didn't have beets but did this with rutabaga, turnips, potatoes, carrots and onion all from the garden. The canned beans added a bit of flavor.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;susan10251012;5;I did not use the beets as I didn't have any. I cut red, white and sweet potatoes, turnips and parsnips, portobello mushrooms, carrots and brussels sprouts into roughly 1-inch cubes and in my 400 degree oven they were done at 35 minutes but tasted better after 45 minutes. I used the wine but didn't notice it in the taste. The brussels sprouts made a nice green and delicious addition to this dish. Did not use garlic. Seasoned with basil and oregano.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;davidblood;4;I needed to bake the veggies for another half hour to get them tender.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;lutzflcat;5;12.19.21 Didn’t dice the veggies for concerns they’d brown up/burn too quickly at 400ºF, just cut into larger pieces. After I took the veggies out after 30 minutes, they were looking a little dry, and when I added the wine, the veggies just absorbed it, so I added a little more. After 7 additional minutes in the oven, I took them out of the oven, and for my taste, they were perfectly cooked. The garbanzo beans was such a small amount that I just omitted them…throw them away or what to do with the leftover garbanzo beans?? I love roasted vegetables, this was a very nice side dish, would make again.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;emptychef;5;This was a hit at thanksgiving, I omitted the chickpeas, used parsnips and heirloom carrots, for the potatoes I used a selection of multicolour mini potatoes. I also did balsamic vinegar in addition to the wine.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;yylien;5;simple recipe but I had to use baking pan so that might have made the cooking time to be longer but overall, it's easy to follow and you can always adjust the seasoning to your liking.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;charlotteanngulley;5;I USED A LARGE SWEET POTATO INSTEAD OF CARROTS
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;emilymiller;5;My family loved this, asked that I make it again soon! I didn't have beets or beet greens, so I subbed collard greens. Super yum!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;laurennickerson;5;These were delicious! I didn't have garbanzo beans and forgot the garlic and they were still delicious! Perfect recipe to use produce from the garden when in season. Yum!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;barbarian;5;"""I may beg you to make this again"" --My Wife I did make a few changes. The beets I got didn't have greens, so I used baby spinach. I used black beans instead of chickpeas. I didn't have any white wine, but I did have my home made lemon & ginger mead and I added 250mL instead of the recommended. I also caramelized the onion with the garlic and oil before putting everything in the roasting pan. The dollop of sour cream I found really balanced out the sweetness of the beets and carrots. YMMV but I certainly recommend adding some acidity."
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;ronborino;5;I basically followed the recipe. I didn't really measure, just kind of chopped and added the veggies. It was fantastic. Frankly, once heated per directions I ended up eating for snacks cold. It is good in my opinion either way.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;sarahferguson;4;Great recipe. I used chicken broth in place of the wine. It would be good with turkey or a roast.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;suzannel;5;I made these changes... I used 1 sweet potato, 1 regular white potato, skin on, I added 3/4 tablespoon of Italian spice as well. Instead of wine, I used white wine vinegar, red wine vinegar, a splash of balsamic vinegar and cranberry cocktail to a total measurement of about 2/3rds cup. I covered the dish for first 30 minutes with tin foil then removed and kept in the over for between 30-35 minutes... result?? I loved it! I had never liked beets either.. this changed me for sure. I definitely would keep beet pieces smaller than the rest of the veggies. Also, I think I might cook the chickpeas a little before adding to the mix. I love chickpeas but these were a little too firm for me. Overall? a big win in my books! Thanks!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;valariemeiserpriestleyperry;5;I also added balsalmic vinegar. It was delicious! I made it for Christmas dinner, and it was a hit!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;lgw;5;Wonderful recipe!! The wine added so much flavor to the veggies. I used a Chardonnay and added potatoes, brussel sprouts and kale. I also used yellow beets to keep the vegetables from turning red from the red beets. Very easy to make. I also used an outdoor charcoal grill to roast them instead of the oven. Took a little longer but the vegetables were wonderful. Family favorite.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;tom;5;Great way to make 1-pan pile of veggies that can be used for a good sized gathering and/or refrigerated for later use. I didn't follow to a T, but used all the ingredients as listed.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;ireneg;5;This was good and it easy to fix. Only changes I made were tossing the veggies with olive oil in a bowl first, used a cookie sheet, chicken broth instead of wine and added a parsnip. Will make again but cut it in half for just the two of us.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;judithbonnett;5;so very good and healthy loved this dish
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;grupbeav;5;Oh my gosh this is so good!!!! I didn’t have the beet greens so used spinach. Also used sweet potato instead of russet and threw in some parsnip. Excellent!!!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;mas;2;Veggies did not cook evenly. Took much longer to bake. Just OK on taste.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;panamajen80;5;This was such a simple recipe and I was really surprised by how great it is! My mom (who doesn't love veggies) even ate them.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;julialad;5;I made this recipe as a side dish during Christmas dinner. It turned out delicious and everyone asked for the recipe. The only changes I made after reading other reviews was adding in balsamic vinegar, and I substituted regular potatoes for sweet potatoes. This will definitely be a keeper!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;jamiecarter;5;Amazing!!!!!!!!!! Thank you for this recipe
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;joko;5;This was wonderful, my 1 year old ate up as much as I could plate him!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;dee;5;Great recipe! Family loved it. I did add sweet potatoes to the mix of veggies and excluded onion as I am allergic. Also added a sprinkle of brown sugar at the end. I’ll definitly make it this way again in the future!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;juliericketts;3;This was good but nothing amazing. I used sweet potato and parsnip along with turnip, beet and brussel sprouts. I should have followed my gut and added the quicker cooking ones after starting the others but I just didn't have the time. So, some were more done than others. I don't blame this on the recipe, that's my doing. But, I did find that the flavours all sort of seeped into one and other so that it kind of all tasted the same. I did add some balsamic which I highly recommend. Oh, and I did leave out the garlic, not that I don't like it but it didn't seem appropriate for Thanksgiving dinner.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;addles;4;This was very good. Added a green pepper and a few mushrooms. After stirring at the end all the veggies were pinkish from the beets so I think next time I will leave it out.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;stank;5;We loved this recipe. I didn't use the potatoes or garbanzo beans. Added Peruvian turnips. This will be a regular at our home.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;johnp;5;Made this for family and friends. My father in law who does not eat veggies had two servings and asked to take some home. Most every thing came straight from my garden. I substituted swiss chard for beet greens, I used blue and white potatoes, and I substituted fresh oregano for thyme. I topped it with cherry tomatoes during the last baking cycle. Perfect!! Not only was this dish beautiful but was undeniably delicious. I will make this again very soon.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;vbottega2;5;Excellent!!!!!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;loretta;4;I have made this a few times now and everyone loved it ! It also fits in nice for a Thanksgiving dinner.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;eireannnm;5;Simple and delicious! I used red potatoes, beets, turnips, sweet potatoes and onions and it came out perfect!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;lyndanelson;5;Very good and easy to prepare. Was looking for a recipe using both beets and the greens. Omitted the beans and served with cut up bratwurst for my guys. I baked it an extra 15 minutes after adding the greens.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;thisnicaza;4;Tasty. More of a technique for roasting, to me, than an actual recipe. I used potatoes, onions, beets, carrots, cauliflower, and zucchini...adding the cauliflower and zucchini after the potatoes and carrots started to soften. Not visually appealing, to me: half-red potatoes and cauliflower. I think in the future I will only roast beets with other dark veggies like carrots, sweet potatoes, or butternut or acorn squash. I also lowered the temp to 375* so the veggies wud cook thru ...but that was a bit low. Will try 400* next time. Thanks for the recipe!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;bridget;5;So good! This recipe is on regular rotation at my house!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;margaretsanchez;5;Easy prep, delicious result. Made this to go with an Easter ham and it was a hit with the family. I will definitely make it again.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;nikki;4;This was good! I've never made anything like this before! I added balsamic vinegar, per suggestions from some of the reviewers, and we didn't love that so next time I'll leave it out. Thanks for the recipe!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;marianmarucaknepshield;5;I have made this several times and must say the family loves it. I have made substitutions for potatoes with sweet potatoes or butternut squash as that's what I had on hand. Nom nom nom!!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;dawnie;4;Hubby and I thought this was pretty good. I normally don't like to rate things if I didn't follow the recipe to the T, but hubby can't have potatoes right now. So I used carrots, parsnips, Brussel sprouts, onions, beans and a beet. It did take a while for this to cook, but it smelled wonderful the whole time it baked. This is our first go at eating parsnips and beets and were pleasantly surprised that we liked them so well. Definitely recommend this recipe and will be making it again, but possibly trying other veggies. Thanks for sharing.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;stachman;3;I followed the instructions. I thought the taste was a bit bland. To get the beet greens to wilt I had to put the dish back in the oven. However, as a long time beet hater I discovered I do like them roasted. I would try this again with some adjustments to the spices & will give the addition of a splash of balsamic vinegar a try.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;rachel;5;Delicious! I chose to use white grape juice instead of white wine, and I kept the dish baking (after I poured the white grape juice in) in the oven for 30 minutes versus 15 minutes.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;feedmyhungryfamily;5;I did a trial run on this dish prior to Christmas, because I want it to be part of our Christmas dinner. For my trial run I used only the root vegetables I had on hand, Brussel sprouts, a sweet potato and onions. It was delicious. I followed your recipe, except I added the garlic to the veggies in the beginning. I look forward to making this dish with the addition of beets and carrots! Thanks for a tasty recipe.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;suzanneduket;3;Kinda weird recipe, beets made it too sweet and dicing everything was a mistake.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;loveaz;5;"Made this recipe (with some modifications) for the first time for an office party and it was a hit! I omitted the garbanzo beans and added in more beets, carrots, and potatoes (using half sweet potatoes and half Yukon gold). I cut the beets, carrots and sweet potatoes into 1/2"" to 1"" cubes and the gold potatoes 2"". Used less onion and garlic and added 1 T of balsamic vinegar to the dry cooking white wine (I didn't have regular wine). I took another reviewer's advice and baked it covered in foil for the first 30 minutes, then stirred in the wine mixture and 1 T of rosemary and baked uncovered for the remaining 20-25 minutes. I also used raw kale instead of the beet greens, mixing those right when removed from the oven so they could wilt into the mixture. It was perfect! I'll be making this one again!"
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;thomasextejt;4;I used what I had on hand, and what I found in the store (potatoes, carrots, turnips and parsnips). I used a light sprinkling of garlic powder instead of garlic cloves. Next time I'll leave the parsnips out. They have too much fiber and didn't roast well even after an hour in the oven. Loved the thyme and the white wine. My company said it was very good.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;bethd;4;Very good. Didn't use parsnips as my family doesn't like them and used thyme leaves instead of ground. Also used fresh Brussels sprouts. Will be making again for sure!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;patriciaohara;5;Have never cooked fresh beets before this recipe. All the flavors mixed together to make a wonderful experience on the pallet. Will definitely make this again. I would not change anything in this recipe
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;barbrowe;4;We did like this although we did make it slightly different. We are not thyme fans so we used a vegetable mixed seasoning. I left the 4 cloves in the skins and roasted them then mashed them and mixed them in just before serving. We left out Garbanzos and potatoes. Put in a lot more beets and carrots. My beet greens were too far gone so did not do that. We may have cooked slightly longer but you say 15m or till tender so that is no big deal. this is a good base and liked the addition of the wine. We have made roasted veggies many times and not seen that. And I had the epiphany this time to roast the garlic and that was much more palatable than minced or shaved garlic or even whole without the skin left on in the roasting process.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;diane;1;We didn't like the flavor...
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;lecile;5;I didn't have all the ingredients in the recipe but used the veggies I had: sweet potatoes, cabbage, turnips, no garlic or beets. We found this to be flavorful and I plan to cook this again using the items called for.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;lyndapoysor;5;I make a variation of this all the time. I am vegetarian so this is a perfect meal by itself or to accompany a slice of bread or anything else on hand. I live in a house trailer so winter is the best time to use the oven and enjoy the two-fold pleasure of baked supper and warm place to sleep. Leftovers are a snap. use the foil and just wrap it up and store in fridge. Next day ready to travel with lunch to go - good cold, too. I like to add a dash of black pepper when it is cold.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;nothingbeast;5;This was an amazing side dish! The wife actually found the recipe to make something different for Thanksgiving, and I was amazed at how great it turned out. Told her it was definitely our new holiday tradition! The vegetables turned out cooked, but still crisp which is how I love them. I was skeptical trading my mashed potatoes for this, but there's no going back for me. And I make some good mashed potatoes.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;amyrogers;5;Loved it and so did my family of very picky eaters!!! I made it with what I had on hand, beets, red potatoes, sweet potatoes carrots, garlic and onions. I did not have a can of garbanzo beans. Was a little skeptical of using the beat greens, but they were incredible and added a lot of flavor, one of our favorite parts of the dish. Thank you for sharing. Will make again and again. I paired with the crispy baked chicken thighs and it was perfect.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;rich;5;"Outstanding recipe. Of course I did not have all the ingredients so used tarragon instead of tyme and blush wine since my supply of dry white was depleated. I had a random assortment of root vegetables but they worked out great; beets, turnips, rutabaga, purple carrots and small potatos."
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;pattys;5;I've already made it again - its a favorite of ours and great for serving a crowd. I paired it with the All-recipes Beef Pot Roast and it was all amazing and received rave reviews from our guests! You'll never boil your vegetables after this.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;lisacinanni;5;So delicious, and easy and so good for you!!! The colours and flavour are fabulous!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;sandys;5;A delicious combination of vegetables and spices, but I omitted the garbanzo beans and instead included chopped parsnips, yams and fresh cilantro and basil. Any vegetables you enjoy would probably work well with this method.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;otiliaherrera;4;I thought it was great and plan to make it for Thanksgiving. The only thing I'm going to change next time around is instead of regular potatoes, I'm going to use sweet potatoes since we're also having mashed for dinner. Enjoy!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;carocar;2;The savor of the beets was just too overwhelming!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;spiceoflife;5;This was very good. You can use whatever vegies you have on hand. I made ours with beets, potatoes, turnips, and onion. I used garlic salt rather than raw garlic. Next time I will try it with raw garlic. I think the beets are a must in this recipe. This recipe gives these vegies an extra oomph!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;hollie;4;I had to take everything but the beets out and let them cook till they were done 'cause they were still crunchy by the time everything else was finished. Things got a little burnt and I thought it was ruined, and it tasted kinda ruined, but I froze it for the week, and somehow magically it was like amazing once reheated! So I love it, 'cause what I need are things I can freeze. lol
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;angelaknight;2;After reading through the reviews, I was excited to make it. I didn't add chickpeas cause it's not well liked in our house. Otherwise I followed the directions pretty closely. We were disappointed because it was flavorless. It required 1 hr+15 min of cooking because the veggies were still firm. Won't make it again.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;eijifuller;5;This was amazing! I didn't have any white wine or olive oil so I used 3 parts water to one part balsamic vinegar and avocado oil. I also used the entire can of garbanzo beans instead of the 1/4 cup. Ate it with some vegan sour cream and am super satisfied. It was a hit with everyone and will definitely become one of our staple meals. Thank you so much!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;nancylynnhancock;5;Great base recipe. I threw in celery, zucchini, a leek and 3 tomatoes that needed to be used up, in addition to baby white potatoes, carrots, onions, garlic and of course beets. Used balsamic as well as white wine. Easy, delicious, loved by the whole family.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;lucias;4;We love the mixture of vegetables. BUT we also found the vegetables not to be soft enough, so I will definitely improve the cooking process. Will cook them covered first with foil for 20 - 25 min and then uncover and cook them for approx. 30 min more.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;jenniferrosette;5;Fabulous and easy to adjust the vegetables to your liking. I add 2 turnips, use 2 1/2 cups of fresh spinich and add more garbanzos. Make with or without the wine as either way is great.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;alysha;4;We liked this...minus the beets! Add turnips instead.=)
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;pandameow14;5;This was delicious. I prepared it exactly as the directions say, except I omitted dry white wine because I didn't have any. It was still fantastic. Next time I might add more garlic because we are garlic-fiends. This is the first time we have ever had beets. That being said, beware of beeturia. Look it up, or else you may be unpleasantly surprised the next day !
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;amthompson;5;Delicious! So simple and perfect for fall/winter. Made exactly as directed.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;theschnack;5;Excellent, and easy to modify. I doubled the beans, added more carrot and garlic. Will do white beans next. Cheers!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;fifi;5;I was skeptical of this recipe but this will definitely be served again and again. Like most others I did no follow the recipe to the letter, but the outcome was delicious. Everyone raved about the piquant flavor that the white wine adds to the primarily sweet roots. In my preparation I roasted for a longer time as I prefer a little more browning to concentrate those sugars on the perimeter of the vegetable. This contrast was outstanding! I was preparing a large quantity and I included parsnips and sweet potatoes. Garbanzos being precooked did not require the same cooking time so I decided to omit, however, if I were preparing this for a vegetarian or vegan I would have added them as a protein. I added all the vegetables into a large plastic container and poured olive oil over them added the other ingredients, closed the container and shook till all were covered. The beautifully colored array made a wonderful presentation.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;misseswaffles;5;Wow, the ingredients and seasonings are simple yet the flavor is fantastic! I used carrots, parsnips, shallots, beets and sweet potatoes. The flavor was lovely and I really liked using the beet greens in the end. I found this recipe just as the leaves are starting to turn...a perfect fall dish!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;kristibatemanhelmer;4;I added a delicata squash that I had on hand in addition to the other recipe ingredients. I didn't have wine so I mixed some apple cider vinegar, red wine vinegar and a touch of balsamic vinegar and a bit of cranberry juice. It was a bit tart and pretty sweet because of the vinegars but very very yummy. I can't wait to try it with wine - I think that would add a nice balance. I ate it over barley with a bit of feta sprinkled in. So good and beautiful too.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;flinkity;5;Amazing! Something I recommend though is not dicing the potatoes, but cutting them in sixths. This dish should not be served as a main dish, but as a side. This is going to be cooked every Friday from now on.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;shannonsnow;5;LOVE this. It could be easily modified for other ingredients. Not being a beet fan, I wasn't sure about it but the wine, garlic, onions and spices added a lot and balanced the dish. I'll be making this often.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;kozytango;5;This recipe was a hit with my (steak and potatoes kind of) husband, Dad, 1-year old, 3-year old, 16-year old. We didn't have wine on hand so I used vermouth. For the veggies, I used parsnips, carrots, onions, turnips, beets and garlic. I also made a regular similar dish that doesn't use the beets just in case I had some fussy ones about the beets. Turns out I didn't need to. I think the kids were attracted to the bright color and then realized they liked it. I did forget to use the salt and pepper in the end. I will definitely try again. I will also try a little higher temp next time too to get the veggies to brown and crisp a little.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;melody;3;I forgot the garlic and it would have been better if I had remembered it but I found the flavor to be very one dimensional - thyme. It was just OK and I won't be making it again.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;cindyloushultz;1;I made these for Thanksgiving. Nobody even finished what was on their plate.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;justfree;5;Delicious. Versital recipe change based on what ingredients you have in the house: use red/green/white onions, sweet potatoes/yams, red/white potatoes, brussel sprouts/cauliflower, red or green cabbage, rutabaga/parsnips/turnips. red/yellow/green peppers. No beet greens? I used chopped fresh spinach leaves. Use 1/8 cup balsamic AND 1/4 cup white wine mixture. Perfect!! I paired this meal with Rachael Rae's Braised Chicken Sausages. It is a perfect pairing.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;stacysnook;5;This was fantastic! Like other reviewers I adding a splash of balsamic vinegar. I also added a tablespoon of pepper flakes. I didn't have beet greens, so I topped it with a little bit of chapped fresh parsley. Served over a combination of white rice and quinoa this was a satisfying meal.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;keeper;5;"I did the beets with carrots in my West Bend slow cooker to avoid heating the oven on a hot summer day and it turned out great! I also used my food chopper to do the onions and all the stems from the greens and sauteed them all with the garlic and some fresh ginger in coconut oil. Definitely a keeper and I will plant more beets this week. Even my hubby who doesn't like beets ate it with some balsamic vinegar and thought it ""interesting"" and would eat again as a side dish."
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;quiltersammy;5;This is a real winner! The fact it's so versatile makes it even more appealing. I cooked mine covered for almost an hour at 400 degrees, added the greens and cooked uncovered for about 15 more minutes. Served it over steamed jasmine rice with a side of Thai cucumbers. Perfect for Meatless Monday's, vegans or vegetarians. Liked the addition of balsamic vinegar too! Pink veggies are pretty unusual don't ya' know!!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;carriegreen;5;"Just got back from the potluck that I brought this dish to. It was a HIT. I was late, so the dish was actually served cold. It was still wonderful. I roasted the beets seperately and added them at the last minute, so all the vegetables still had thier own color. I used beets, rutabega, turnip, carrot, sweet potato, russet potato, greens (kale), red onion, chick peas (made my own, not canned). I used the olive oil and italian seasoning (with thyme) and dry white wine (Kendal Jackson Chardonay to be excact). It was wonderful. These vegetables are full of flavor; roasting enhances the flavor."
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;jennifer;5;Loved it. I made it with no beets and added celery and a rutabaga. I had no white wine so made it with sherry cooking wine. Delicious and easy. Just chop and mix!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;lmc5238;5;This is a great recipe! Awesome way to eat some veggies that I don't usually eat.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;patricia;4;I'm always looking for ways to incorporate power foods into my husband's meet and potato's diet... I loved this dish but he didn't. I'll definitely make this again for me but will need to continue looking for veggies he will eat!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;liquidfaith;5;Love it! What an amazing array of flavor going on in this dish, though I love all these veggies. It's so simple and can be very versatile. I added sweet potato and extra garlic and kale toward the end...and some balsamic vinegar. This one is a keeper!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;hataxa;5;Amazing! Will definitely repeat!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;juliev;5;Served these Christmas day to people who don't eat foods that look like this. They all sampled and loved it! I used sweet potatoes instead of white. This recipe is a keeper!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;betseynorland;5;I omitted the white potatoes, because it was for Thanksgiving dinner and there were already two kinds of potatoes on the menu, and substituted parsnips and sweet potatoes. Also, I omitted the garbanzo beans, but only because m husband doesn't like them. I imagine they would be an interesting addition. This was a huge success at our family gathering. I especially liked the colorful addition of the beet greens. I considered adding some purple top turnips to the mix, but was afraid the strong flavor might not appeal to some at a large gathering. I did cook some separately, though, and added them to the leftovers. It was a delicious addition.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;heatherlilly;4;Very tasty. Tried it as a main dish, and I don't think I would do that again, but it would work very well as a side dish.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;electrifyingirl;5;"This is AMAZING! I only made very slight changes; I used onion powder (my kids won't eat onions) and doubled the amount of garbanzo beans. I also used kale in place of the torn beet greens. Fantastic! Thank you so much for this phenomenal recipe!"
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;cookin4myfamily;5;This was my first experience cooking with beets, and I'm so glad I tried this recipe. The colors are beautiful with the red beets and the wilted greens so this dish has lots of eye appeal plus the recipe is full of healthy ingredients. I used the full amount of thyme and also added a large sprig of rosemary and a little garlic powder.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;onlycallisto;5;Very simple to make, and I love how it makes use of those pesky beet greens! I bought these beets without the greens because I was tired of throwing them away, but next time I'll keep them on just for this dish! The addition of chickpeas is great, I would even add more if you're a fan. I didn't have wine, so I just used water with a small splash of apple cider vinegar. Different herbs would also be great for this, like sage or rosemary.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;laesposa;5;"Excellent! Couldn't believe that even my picky 6 year old said, ""Mom, you can make this again!"" He liked everything but the greens. I made recipe as stated, except for adding a little more potato and omitting the chickpeas. Thank you for a great way to roast root vegetables!"
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;bethashley;3;For me this recipe was just OK. Next time I will omit the garlic for sure. I am a garlic lover but not a raw garlic lover and I find it doesn't cook enough. I might try this again with a few adjustments.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;mamav;1;Unfortunately, this was not something we enjoyed. Kinda bland and seemed like a lot of work for a dish this simple.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;brett;3;This is a great way to make anyone love veggies, but I ran into problems with my batches both times I made it. My veggies are never tender enough, and the flavor can get a bit monotonous after a big helping of it. I'll definitely keep experimenting with it though, because I'm not a huge veggie lover, and I can eat quite a bit of this stuff.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;gina51283;4;I left out the garbanzo beans because I didn't have them. I really liked the addition of the beet greens to the roasted vegetables.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;ajkasten;4;I took the advice of many other reviewers. I did half sweet potato and half red potatoes. I also did half wine and half balsamic vinegar and added 1 tablespoon of Italian Seasoning along with the 1 tablespoon of thyme. I also added an extra clove of garlic. In the end, it was very good, but I think next time, I will add some garlic salt, which I added to it when it was on my plate and was very good. And maybe even add more types of veggies, like green pepper and sugarsnap peas. Would make a great Thanksgiving side!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;bobbi123;4;Good mix of veggies, but could use just a tad more seasoning. I'll make again and try using some italian seasoning. I also think sweet potatoes and parsips would be a good addition.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;mitsue;5;simple, delicious, absolutely worth while. i added a little seasoned salt (just a dash) and some italian herbs because I didn't have just plain thyme. I threw a splash of balsamic vinegar on it at the end too, just for a little extra something. it was perfect!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;cricketmarie;5;Excellent! I love the flavor of the wine with balsamic! A very wonderful way to eat your root vegetables. I had everything but the carrots on-hand from my CSA, and it was a great dish (and leftover) to make.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;janicebabbs;5;This dish was beyond delicious, I can't wait to make it again. It is particularly good for people who are members of CSAs or do frequent farmer's market shopping, as it combines a host of common, locally-grown vegetables. The potatoes and chickpeas make it hardy so that it can be served as a meal, not just a side. Try it!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;luckycharm;5;Very easy -- most time-consuming was preparing the veggies (I scrub, wash, and sanitize mine). I used carrot greens instead of beet, because the carrots I bought today had tops, and the beet didn't (they were sold out). Still tastes great -- a healthy dish that I can heat up as leftovers for my next two very busy days!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;frizzycat;5;I add white sweet potato, sweet potato, parsnips and serve over quinoa. It's delicious.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;melindarrose;5;We love this recipe! It's healthy and can be adapted to any veggies on hand. Thank you for submitting it!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;desertdutchman;5;Served with standing rib roast for Christmas dinner. A very good compliment to the beef (and also the red wine). A definite keeper.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;emilie;5;Perfect everytime. People ask me to make this now, I love making it and I love eating it. The chick peas threw me off at first but are a staple for this dish.. Thanks
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;rmsr;5;Delicious! I did omit the chickpeas and beet greens (mine were the bagged kind sold without the greens). I used the vegetables the recipe called for, but in different amounts. The dish was nicely seasoned. I've never had roasted beets before, just the pickled sort and they are way better than I imagined! My vegetables didn't turn too pink, just a light tinge. A keeper for sure!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;shannona;4;Liked the combination of vegetables. I used fresh thyme since that's what I had, but obviously didn't use enough as it really needed more seasoning.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;courtneyb228;4;This is a very good recipe, but I'm afraid it wasn't enough to convert my beet-hating husband. Be sure to follow the recipe amounts very closely. I made the mistake of adding too much diced beet into the dish, and it overwhelmed the potatoes and carrots a little. However, if you already like beets (like my son and I) then you will really enjoy this dish. I grated fresh mozzarella cheese and sprinkled it on top right before serving. Very yummy! I'll be sure to make it again - if my hubbie is out for the night.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;chandra;4;This was very good and my 20-month old son liked it, too. I used a red onion and added a shallot and some spinach. I'll definitely make it again!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;christyacb;5;Taking the advice of others, I also added a splash of good balsamic vinegar to the recipe. The recent heat had made my beet greens bitter, so I just harvested the beet and instead of greens, added some freshly picked peas during the last 5 minutes. Very tasty but would only work really well with very fresh peas. I added a small early red onion from the garden with a small Juane onion instead of just one big yellow onion. I would never have thought of this recipe for myself and it is a keeper. The chiogga beets give it a very pleasing visual appearance and mellow sweetness. Definitely will change your mind on what you think of beets!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;bakker;4;Good quick solution for beets. Also can be modified depending on the root veggies you have around. I prefer it without the beans.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;pkd;5;Fantastic! Forgot the beans, but added celeriac (cubed), sunchokes & parsnips to the beets, onions, potatoes & carrots. The wine, added at the end, mingles with the carmelized veggie flavors & adds a delicious punch. If you didn't taste the wine, you didn't add enough. I baked 15-20 min, added wine, stirred/turned, which caused the wine to sizzle & boil down almost immediately. Back for 5-10 min & done. Gorgeous. My husband & sons, who don't love beets, loved this.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;jeneanp;5;I just made this for dinner tonight and it was so super great. I used purple and orange beets that didn't have stems attached, added sweet potatoes and about a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar. I didn't have any white wine so I substituted it with chicken broth and a bit of lemon juice. Good stuff!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;vivnidhi;5;"Too good. Delicious! Only changed the white wine to 1 part white wine vinegar and 3 parts water. This is really really good, beet haters will also eat it with pleasure like my husband;-)"
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;janet;5;I followed the suggestion and added about a T. of balsamic vinegar and sweet potatoes. It was wonderful. I will also use this as a recipe for just beets.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;stephaniemorissette;5;"Wow! I know it's just a bunch of root vegetables, but this was really good. I am not a big fan of beets but the veggies just go so sweet, even the beets weren't well, ""beety""... I made a huge batch and served it at Christmas diner and people loved it. The color was beautiful! The only change I made was to omit the chick peas and add parsnips. Thanks for this great recipe!"
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;kelcampbell;4;Yummy - we loved this! I left out the beet greens because mine were a little on the limp side - and I added about 1 tsp of dried rosemary in place of the thyme (thyme isn't a fave in our house). I didn't find the wine added very much flavor and the chick peas added a great flavor and texture. Thanks for an awesome recipe!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;mysharona;5;I am in love with this recipe. SOOO GOOD SOOO EASY!!!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;anneb;5;This is not only beautiful but also delicious. Different colors and textures add to the appeal.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;deb4005;4;I really liked this recipe, however, I felt like there was something missing. Couldn't put my finger on it though. Maybe I will add balsamic vinegar as suggested.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;jen333;5;YUM! I added some balsamic vinegar, as another reviewer suggested. Totally delicious. I might add cranberries and mushrooms, and maybe a red pepper next time, but I'll definitely make this again.
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;breadmantalking;5;I make a similar dish adding sweet potatoes along with the regular. Also, I have tried balsamic vinegar which adds a little sweetness if you like that. Absolutely scrumptious!!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;venessia;5;OMG! How did you come up with this recipe?! It is absolutely scrumptious!! With these ingredients being harvested right now locally (I live in Tucson, AZ), I was able to use all organically grown fresh vegetables and it was simply divine. Thank you so much for sharing this!
2f9a9686-bf1c-4d5e-9bdd-1f0b8a9258ae;janedough;5;I love the spices and the use of the dry white wine! (added some salt to taste). I used veggies I had on hand: sweet potato, red potato, carrots, onion, brussels sprouts. Everything was cooked perfectly. The onion was delicious! My husband isn't usually too excited about veggies I cook,but he LOVED these and couldn't stop complimenting!
fb7c5f5c-6073-454b-b354-d6cc47328edd;kittydevany;4;I think I'd leave them in longer next time so it gets a little crisper, but they were pretty tasty! I used Cajun seasoning in place of garlic salt and would probably add more of that next time too.
fb7c5f5c-6073-454b-b354-d6cc47328edd;franwilliams;5;I used fresh okra. I dried the cut pieces on a paper towel in a bowl, then removed the paper towel and sprayed with butter spray, then tossed with corn meal mix and roasted garlic salt seasoning. A dash of tumeric added for a little extra pizzas. I had to run up the temperature to450 at the end for about 5 minutes to get the browned crunchy texture we were looking for. They came out great!
fb7c5f5c-6073-454b-b354-d6cc47328edd;ahilamanivannan;2;I would pass on this recipe - there are some flavor elements missing and I think coating the okra in egg like another recipe suggested might be the way to go.
fb7c5f5c-6073-454b-b354-d6cc47328edd;macdoesit;5;, yum
fb7c5f5c-6073-454b-b354-d6cc47328edd;cherdumas;5;I can’t stand okra unless it’s breaded. It’s so slimy. So I found this recipe and I didn’t have to throw the okra away. It came out delicious! I didn’t have any corn meal so I used ground oats instead. They came out perfect! I read one of the reviews and the reviewer commented that she had trouble with the cornmeal not sticking to the okra. With the ground oats- I had no problem with it coating the okra. I will definitely make this again.
fb7c5f5c-6073-454b-b354-d6cc47328edd;kbkrueger;4;I used fresh okra, spray on olive oil, added some cajun spice and some minced dried onions. It is tasty, next time I might flour and egg it before I toss it into the cornmeal and panko mix. I like a heavier coating. I baked it on parchment paper at 380' for 30 mins. I love to read the reviews and adapt with what sounds good.
fb7c5f5c-6073-454b-b354-d6cc47328edd;sarah;2;The concept was great, and it's possible that trying to cook it in a toaster oven (because it's too hot to use the regular oven) was my problem. But I resorted to pan frying the okra because it just wasn't cooking. I will not make this recipe again.
fb7c5f5c-6073-454b-b354-d6cc47328edd;mbrown330;3;It’s just ok. But nothing like the fried okra I grew up on.
fb7c5f5c-6073-454b-b354-d6cc47328edd;msbrook2;5;"My husband and son really liked this version of ""Fried Okra"" - and my son is a very picky eater. I adapted it as follows: 1) used fresh okra and cooked it in the microwave for 5 minutes before coating. 2) used a coating of 1/3 c. cornmeal, 1/8 c. flour and added 3/4 t seasoned salt, 3/4 t. garlic salt, 1/8 t. pepper and 1/8 t. paprika. Next time I might add another 1/2 t. regular salt as well. 3)I sprayed the okra with Olive Oil before baking, but did so after I'd placed them on the baking sheet, not before I coated them with the cornmeal mixture. 4) I baked them at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes, then flipped and baked another 10-15 minutes. I used non-stick foil on a baking sheet to keep cleanup easy. Tasted very similar to my mom's fried Okra but much healthier."
fb7c5f5c-6073-454b-b354-d6cc47328edd;kflukeman;4;"As a southern girl, I was a bit skeptical trying an ""oven fried"" version of one of my all-time favorite southern foods. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at how this recipe turned out. I subbed seasoning salt for the garlic salt and olive oil for the cooking spray, though."
fb7c5f5c-6073-454b-b354-d6cc47328edd;dstein;5;These were so yummy! I was even eating them raw with the seasoning on them. Yum!
fb7c5f5c-6073-454b-b354-d6cc47328edd;angelika;4;This was an easy and healthy way for me to prepare the package of frozen cut okra that I'd bought on a whim. I used this recipe as a basic template. In a ziploc baggie, I mixed about 1 or 1.5 c almond meal, a heavy dosage of creole seasoning, dried onions, salt and pepper. I nuked the frozen okra, added it to the ziploc (without any butter spray or oils), then shook it all together. Poured it out onto a cookie sheet and baked at 375 for 20 minutes. It could have used the full 25 minutes but these were delicious AND gluten free! My husband dipped his in ranch. I will be buying another bag for those evenings that I need a quick, easy appetizer! Thank you for helping me put okra in my arsenal!
fb7c5f5c-6073-454b-b354-d6cc47328edd;truefire8181;5;This is a wonderful recipe if you love fried okra but need to be mindful of your health. It still has flavor and crunch! Thank you for submitting this recipe.
fb7c5f5c-6073-454b-b354-d6cc47328edd;gale;5;My family loved this as a healthier alternative to fried okra! Will definitely use again!
fb7c5f5c-6073-454b-b354-d6cc47328edd;rox;4;Needed to cook 30 minutes. Also add cayenne pepper. Quick and easy! Will make again...
fb7c5f5c-6073-454b-b354-d6cc47328edd;crissie;4;Very good! Even my kids liked it!! I used spray I Can't Believe It's Not Butter and not butter flavored cooking spray. Will definitely make again. Served as a side with Grilled Shrimp Scampi (search for it on this site!) and grilled asparagus. Thanks for the recipe!!
fb7c5f5c-6073-454b-b354-d6cc47328edd;katherine;4;I used Stillwells frozen breaded okra. I put olive oil on the pan and I cooked it at 400 degrees for 15 minutes and turned it over part way through. It turned out good.
fb7c5f5c-6073-454b-b354-d6cc47328edd;christy;5;We love this recipe and have it quite often. I lightly coat the okra with olive oil before placing in the bag -- I like this better than the cooking spray. Also use seasoning salt instead of garlic salt. I have also used this recipe with fresh okra, but you have to cook it in the microwave for about 5 minutes to get it gooey enough to work.
fb7c5f5c-6073-454b-b354-d6cc47328edd;lesabrooksreddick;4;Really liked it, good alternative to fried okra, much less guilt!
fb7c5f5c-6073-454b-b354-d6cc47328edd;kristi;5;Great snack, and I felt guilt free eating the last few okra of the season from my grandma's garden.
fb7c5f5c-6073-454b-b354-d6cc47328edd;cookingmonster;1;This just didn't work for me. I usually like anything okra, but maybe I'm just too used to real fried okra to enjoy this. As I was eating it, I wished I had just heated up the frozen okra and eaten it plane. Wouldn't make this again.
fb7c5f5c-6073-454b-b354-d6cc47328edd;huntersmommy;5;awesome! my husband and i loved it!
fb7c5f5c-6073-454b-b354-d6cc47328edd;joy;5;Such a tasty, healthy way to prepare okra. I also make this without the cornmeal and bread crumbs. Just a light coat of olive oil, salt and pepper is good. My family prefers this recipe, however. Thank you for sharing it with us.
fb7c5f5c-6073-454b-b354-d6cc47328edd;sandyclarkgerhardt;5;Hi all...I'm the submitter of this recipe. This recipe works best with CUT okra. It is a little gooey/wet after microwaving and though you drain it on paper towels, it is still a little damp which helps the cornmeal/panko mixture stick. I hope this helps. Happy Eatting!
fb7c5f5c-6073-454b-b354-d6cc47328edd;momi;4;Pretty good. I used chopped okra. I melted a little bit of butter on the okra after it microwaved (I don't use cooking spray), and I had no problem with the crumbs sticking. The crumbs could use more seasoning. Thanks for sharing!
fb7c5f5c-6073-454b-b354-d6cc47328edd;witchywoman;2;I really do like okra, but I had such a problem with the panko crumbs sticking to these with just the non-stick spray that they had me wanting to pull my hair out! I'm giving this a 2 star review because my okra hating husband said that I managed to get the slime out of them. I think if I were to attempt making these again, I would roll them in flour, then dip in an egg-wash and then roll in straight cornmeal. In my opinion, it was a waste of my panko crumbs. Thank you for submitting the recipe, I really did want to like it.
fb7c5f5c-6073-454b-b354-d6cc47328edd;stacymcvay;4;Being a southern gal, I'm a big fan of okra. I thought this recipe was really good. My only complaint was that it was a bit dry. I didn't have the panko bread crumbs so I used plain, I'm not sure if that would make a difference or not. I'm definitely going to try this again tweaking the oven and such. It's definitely worth keeping a playing around with.
8bf18a8a-1c26-44c5-994e-1f4877fbafaa;ediwa;3;It stuck to the bottom of my Instant Pot, so I lost about a third of it. Also found it to be too much salt, and I only used 1 tsp. Otherwise, good and I will tweak and try it again.
8bf18a8a-1c26-44c5-994e-1f4877fbafaa;denisevalkyrie;5;I added to it. I added brown sugar, Cardamom and a tsp butter. And two apples. Yummy!
8bf18a8a-1c26-44c5-994e-1f4877fbafaa;jakecampbell;4;Sift cinnamon and oatmeal well before adding to the pot for better consistency.
8bf18a8a-1c26-44c5-994e-1f4877fbafaa;jennifergarnermillner;4;I made the recipe and it turned out a little runny. I let it sit for a minute, and it thickened up. I added some sugar to it and that was all it needed. I would add a little less water than what was called for.
8bf18a8a-1c26-44c5-994e-1f4877fbafaa;kristyhebenstreithuber;1;Well, as son as they came to pressure I got the burn warning. Made them exactly as the recipe called for. 3 cups water, 1 cup oats, apples and seasonings. Not sure what else to try :(
8bf18a8a-1c26-44c5-994e-1f4877fbafaa;leanne;4;Pretty good, added brown sugar on top after cooking! I'll make it again
8bf18a8a-1c26-44c5-994e-1f4877fbafaa;jodi;5;So good! No sweetener needed. I used two apples and added about 1/4 tsp each of ginger and allspice. Also reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp according to package instructions. So tasty!
8bf18a8a-1c26-44c5-994e-1f4877fbafaa;bethsbasket;5;I use 1 cup apple juice and 2 cups of water. I also add a tsp of vanilla and 2 -3 apples
8bf18a8a-1c26-44c5-994e-1f4877fbafaa;deborahdeppe;5;Terrific and easy! I used 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice because, you know, it’s finally fall in FL!
8bf18a8a-1c26-44c5-994e-1f4877fbafaa;recipehound;5;I made this for breakfast today and it was very tasty. I used half cup steel cut oats & half cup old-fashioned oats. I also added a tablespoon or so of real maple syrup. I cooked as directed and had several options for toppings. I have just enough left-over for my breakfast tomorrow!
8bf18a8a-1c26-44c5-994e-1f4877fbafaa;angelacarroll;5;"Delicious! I used the ""delay start"" function on my Instant Pot so they were hot and ready when we got up in the morning. I like my oats a little softer, so I used a little longer cooking time."

It is an excellent recipe as written, but since we make it all the time, we have made many modifications, including adding raisins or dried cherries instead of the apples.
8bf18a8a-1c26-44c5-994e-1f4877fbafaa;lorrainejeanross;5;I added a little more water and some almond coconut milk before cooking. I added raisins and maple syrup and some half & half before serving.

8bf18a8a-1c26-44c5-994e-1f4877fbafaa;timarachancellor;5;I made it with Old Fashioned oats, I did NOT add any salt, I cut about 1/2 an inch apples into squares, I made it in a baking pan instead of the pressure cooker, I let it stay in the over a little longer until cooked, and I added brown sugar on top. I absolutely love this dish and I used all the measurements and ingredients that was listed and I now have breakfast for myself for the next 3-4 days. Thank you.
8bf18a8a-1c26-44c5-994e-1f4877fbafaa;stovalldb;4;Just started using my Instant Pot so very early in the learning stage. After reading the other comments, decided to not add the salt and did add Maple Syrup. I also had not tried Steel Cut Oats so I had to get use to the different consistency from regular oatmeal. My apple pieces seemed to disappear so next time I will just use my apple cutter but up it to 2 apples.
8bf18a8a-1c26-44c5-994e-1f4877fbafaa;dianemcclure;4;After reading the reviews and made these modifications...I had regular oats (not steel cut) so I set the pressure for 5 minutes but didn't wait until the pressure released naturally. I manually released the pressure and I did not have the burned or stuck to the bottom of the pan and mentioned by Erin. I only added the maple syrup to the recipe. It came out well and I will make it this way again.
8bf18a8a-1c26-44c5-994e-1f4877fbafaa;erinkeltz;4;This tasted great, but I used the same amount of liquid and oats as the recipe states, and jt burned in my instant pot. I was still able to eat it though. I’m not sure why I had that issue.
8bf18a8a-1c26-44c5-994e-1f4877fbafaa;tammylynn;3;"I really like steel cut oats and thought this was the perfect consistency. I wish I had cut my apples in a bit bigger chunks; I diced them rather small. My problem with this recipe was the amount of salt called for. I should have known better, but I was still tired this morning, and I put in the full 1/2 tsp salt. It was too salty for me. I added a couple tablespoons of brown sugar, which helped. I wouldn't add more than an 1/8 tsp of salt in the future. I added some half and half on top, which is a nice touch, and they were okay."
8bf18a8a-1c26-44c5-994e-1f4877fbafaa;lutzflcat;3;5.25.18 Although we love oatmeal, honestly, we’re not huge steel cut oats fans, but I keep trying to acquire a taste for them. Consistency was pretty thick, so I did add some vanilla almond milk and some maple syrup, and I must say I liked it MUCH better after the addition of those two ingredients. We’re not big into sweetness these days, but I think this needed some sweetness, and the maple syrup took care of that. I like the combo of ingredients in this recipe, they partnered well, just didn’t care for the texture of the oats. I plan to try this again with regular oatmeal, and if it turns out more to our satisfaction, I’ll do an update for any other folks who also may not be steel cut oats fans. It certainly is super simple to make, and that I love. I’m the first reviewer, and I don’t want to discourage anybody from trying this. My comments are based on our personal taste preferences. Pamela Wurtz, thanks for sharing your recipe.

e4635ae0-6197-479f-afdc-74c1934ba86b;kim;5;"This is almost one of those 'non-recipe recipes' that everybody should have in their kitchen arsenal--where simple, straightforward ingredients come together to make a fantastic dish. I love the simplicity of this; and that it really is all about the berries. You can adjust the sugar amount depending on how sweet your berries are, and you can also use any berries you may have on hand. If you let the berries sit in the fridge for 30 minutes before serving, they'll be even better--as it allows them to release their juices a bit. You can also eat this with anything: serve with yogurt or whipped cream; add to your morning oatmeal; dollop some on a slice of pound cake; or just sit there and try to not eat the whole bowl in one sitting (like me). Thank you so much for sharing your recipe--this is wonderful!"

e4635ae0-6197-479f-afdc-74c1934ba86b;bellepepper;5;Wonderful, fresh berries are in all the markets this time of year, so of course, I had to buy them all! I found this recipe as a way to use them all in one recipe. I didn’t use the sugar in this, but instead I lightly dressed the berries with some leftover dressing I’d made for my Orzo and Wild Rice Salad. I also added some fresh pineapple that I had and liked the color contrast it provided. I served this on some bright, beautiful baby lettuce from Hubs’ garden. So, if you’ve got berries, this is a good and simple way to use them!
e4635ae0-6197-479f-afdc-74c1934ba86b;naples34102;4;I skipped the blackberries (not crazy about them) and just added more raspberries. As is my preference, I sprinkled the fruit with brown sugar rather than white and poured a little cream over each serving in pretty dessert dishes. Easy, elegant and delicious.
e4635ae0-6197-479f-afdc-74c1934ba86b;sarahjo;5;One of my favorite fruit salads. To really add a touch of class, drizzle a quality balsamic over the sugar and berries and toss well. Let it sit for 15-20 minutes. Spoon that over vanilla bean ice cream. Completely awesome.

1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;debhorvath30;4;My Italian family substitues chicken broth for at least half the water. Before starting the water/broth brown onions, then fry some hard salami that's been cubed and drain both on paper towels. Also cube brick cheese, or other mild white melty cheese. Stir into polenta when it's nearly done along with some heavy cream. Allow to cook further until cream is absorbed. When pulling away from pot and firm, turn out on to wood board covered with a clean cotton towel in center of table. Pull sides of towel up over top to help it hold its shape and let it sit for 10-15 minutes. It will still be very hot. This is not a grits style of polenta. It should hold its shape. It's excellent with chicken cooked in a red sauce and spooned over the polenta or pork and sauerkraut.
1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;juliehammond;5;I give 5 because the ingredients are correct for a basic polenta recipe. Use your brain though and do not follow instructions. Recipes are just a basis starting point. You literally just boil the water (spiced, if that's what you want), remove from burner and whisk in corn meal. That's it, no cooking involved. I refrigerate to firm, but only because I want to.
1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;vitaminp63;4;Pretty good, super basic, easy, much stirring but I felt accomplished as a beginning cook.
1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;jajam;5;To the people who think cornmeal equals polenta, that is not so. Polenta is also known as corn grits, a very coarse kind of ground corn which makes a very creamy cooked polenta, Which the finished product is also called. This is a standard recipe, and the proper way to make it. I’ll try to post a picture of polenta and cornmeal side-by-side.
1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;maureen;5;I did not make any changes and I will make it again. It came out perfectly.

1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;charlenesnoto;4;purchased Golden Pheasant polenta instead of my usual corn meal. It is more coarsely ground than standard cornmeal. I cooked it once like regular corn muffins and it was a bit dry and mealy. i didn't care for it. Should have followed these directions first. will try again!
1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;goofygirl;4;Yes I used regular cornmeal and it worked fine with a shorter cooking time,, I think you might be able to use grits however I don't know if they would set up the same way that regular cornmeal does. Top with pasta sauce and parmesan cheese.

I think something like this is for a more experienced cook than a novice. A novice would be very disappointed in the recipe."

I found the best way to add the cornmeal gradually into the water after it had boiled, that way you arent waiting ages for a watery mixture to go thick, i then added sheep's cheese, gave it a very rustic ""straight from the farm"" taste. I cannot wait to try variations!!"

1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;fanznanz;3;I use the ratio of water to polenta 5 to 1. So, if you use 1 cup of corn meal you need 5 cups of water. The other thing I did was mix 1 C corn meal with 5 C water about an hour before I planned to cook. This gave the corn meal time to absorb water. Then I placed it on the burner and within about 30 minutes had a bubbling pot of polenta. The presoak seems to make a tremendous difference in the cooking time. Hope this observation helps.

1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;pat;4;Good basic recipe. I have been.making polenta for years, learned from my parents. It tastes better if you use coarse ground corn meal ( I found it at Sprouts, Whole Foods and also packaged by Red Mill ). Salt the water like you would for pasta, add meal to boiling water using a whisk to break up lumps. Mix often with a sturdy wooden spoon, it needs to cook at least 30 min or it will taste raw. I found 1 to 3 ratio to be good, it will thicken as it cools. Using less water will make it very firm and hard to mix.
1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;suzana;3;"First, this recipe lacks one ingredient - SALT. You should add a pinch of salt to the boiling water (at least here, where I live, corn meal is sold as is - not pre-salted). Second - cooking time depends on the type of corn meal (so called ""instant"" corn meal takes just a couple of minutes to cook, while regular cm takes much longer. However, both types need constant stirring. How to ""upgrade"" the dish? You can add in a little of butter or grated parmesan cheese (or both) while stirring. Then you can pour cooked polenta into a dish of whatever shape, put it in a cold-water bath or just let it cool down completely, then turn over onto a cutting board, cut into slices and arrange them into a baking dish (ceramic or glass) - a slice of polenta, a slice of cheese and/or ham and so on) ... Mix an egg or two with some cooking cream and pour over the slices and bake in an oven until sizzling and golden brown."
1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;amy;4;I added a good pinch of salt to the hot water, before adding the corn meal. I served it with cheese melted in it and sprinkled Louisiana hot sauce over it.
1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;fancynancy;5;I cook polenta in a crock pot. I use 3 cups of cold water or stock mixed with 1 cup of corn meal and cook it in a small crock pot on low for 4 hours or more. When fully cooked and the water is absorbed I mix in any other cooked ingredients (like cooked corn or sauteed mushrooms or cheese)and pour into a 7x11 brownie pan and refrigerate until firm (at least a couple of hours or overnight). When ready to serve I cut the firm Polenta into squares or triangles or circles and pan fry in a small amount of butter or olive oil for 3-5 minutes on each side until brown and crispy.

It may be hard to find in your area .. best bet to find real polenta is a Italian market, Whole Foods or if you are fortunate in the ethnic section in a grocery store. the 3 to 1 ratio is good tho you need to add plenty of salt to the water since the polenta will soak it up fast. Stir constantly until almost done to avoid lumps. Once your polenta is almost al denta stir 2 tbls. butter to it and serve."

And unlike other starches that one can dress up like pasta or rice, polenta does NOT suck most of the flavor out of the sauce you add do it. I would even go so far as to say it enhances it. Asf for finding something called 'Polenta' in the store, some have said no such thing exists, rather it is Corn Meal you seek..Well, this is only half true. Italian Delicatessens and probably some upscale markets do sell a product called 'Polenta' which is considerably more coarse than ordinary Corn Meal.

1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;deadlyalize;3;Ok you got three stars because polenta is NASTY made with just water IMHO. however, using chicken or beef stock * or boullion* makes it better. you can even use vegetable stock. play with the recipe a little bit and you have the outer layer of your tamales. to answer the question about how to it cylindrical, use a clean empty coffee can * a small one*. grease the inside, add the prepared polenta, let it cool, use a can opener to cut off the bottom and push it out and slice it. my family always fried it in a little bacon grease. my dad would add shredded pork to it while it was cooking and then slice and fry it. hope this helps you out. another thing to get rounds, pour it out on a shallow cookie sheet, let it cool then cut it with a cookie cutter. just remember to grease the pan so it comes out easy.
1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;mrsmaggiehunter;4;fantastic base recipe - you can use any combination of stuff to dress it up! mine cooked in much less time though - more like 5 mins then 15!
1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;catherinevillanueva;5;"Very easy to prepare, mine is usually done in around 20 minutes. Tastes great after chilled overnight, this is a great starter. Do not use masa! The flavor will be completely off. Course cornmeal is the way to go, or if you prefer regular will work and seems lower in calories. If you buy cornmeal that says ""polenta"" it will cost extra just for these words to be printed on the box."
1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;rosabela;4;This is a great basic recipe to start with, however, the cooking time is way off. Mine thickened up within a few minutes. My mom and I used to make polenta and she used to add some salt and a dab of butter for a richer flavour. NOTE: no need to reduce water. Keep stirring until it thickens and then let it cool a bit ... it will automatically thicken up some more. Definitely a keeper!
1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;cathy;5;Good starter recipe! I used 1/2 cup less water as suggested by some, put half the cornmeal in 1 cup cold water-brought remaining water to a boil, (to which I added a sprig of fresh rosemary and a little salt)-then stirred in the cold mixture. It cooked very quickly. Then folded in about a tablespoon cream cheese and 1/4 cup shredded cheddar-rolled it up in plastic wrap to be sliced later. Served hot medallions with red Italian meat sauce. Yummy!
1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;kaz;4;I agree with others who pointed out that this recipe could confuse someona who may not know that the ingredients are water & cornmeal however what surprized me was that there were so many rather compex methods for adding the cornmeal. I have found that the best way to incorporate the cornmael is to use a wire balloon whisk. The trick seems to be the water, it must be at a full boil then just pour the dry cornmeal in a steady stream while whisking it...In two minutes it is ready. ...I have never tried quick cornmeal the regular inexpensive stuff form my grocery store works well.
1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;charlenesledge;5;"Polenta...Golden Pheasant has a brand of corn meal called Polenta. Yes it's the finished product's name but it is also the name for the type of corn meal used. Regular corn meal is less coarsely ground! I am in a Itailian family from Italy. In making polenta from the ""real"" corn meal"" it takes quite awhile and some arm muscle to get the job done! This is great sliced thin once set and grilled with cheese added after removed from heat or add herbs & cheese before it sets up. Chicken in a red sauce over this is delicious as well as many other dishes (sausage and onions grilled) or just get creative. Jazz it up! You can also serve before it sets and it is softer in texture. Chow!"

1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;meganb;3;The flavor was was rather bland. Next time I will try adding salt or some type of flavoring.
1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;kristin;4;Good starter recipe. You can always tweak it to your personal preferences. I like a denser polenta, so I used a bit less water. Unfortunately, it turns out my husband doesn't care for polenta, so I'll probably not be making it again. :-(
1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;giovanna;5;this is a great recipe...in defense of the original recipe...polenta can be used to describe the grain as well as the dish. i personally do not like 'polenta' made from the stuff in the blue and orange box at the store called 'cornmeal'. my mom grew up in a very italian home where polenta as they knew it was made with a very coarsely ground cornmeal. my understanding is that polenta is simply the italian word for cornmeal. if there's any way you can get very coarsely ground cornmeal...it's much more authentic as far as what the northern italians centuries ago used to eat and i think it has much more flavor than the finely ground kind. we've tried grinding corn in our large grinder (that we use for wheat) - and even the coarsest setting is significantly finer than the polenta we buy in bulk through the health food store. *Shrug* anyway...good recipe :)

1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;jessicahill;5;"Great basic recipe. I used slightly less water than called for (which allows the cornmeal to thicken MUCH quicker-- approx. five minutes). I also added about 1/2 tsp. salt to the water. After thickening, I stirred in some chopped green olives, sun-dried tomatoes, and shredded parmesan cheese. I then sprayed a wax-paper lined cutting board with PAM, spread the mixture out, and let it cool. After 20 minutes or so, I hand-packed the whole thing into a log shape and sliced it into medallions. Then I pan-fried the medallions in olive oil. They were soooooo yummy, kind of like polenta ""fritters"" I guess. Delish!"
1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;mcmeg12;5;Simple and works. Keep stirring to keep the bottom from burning. You could also add a pinch of salt, much like you would to rice.
1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;loradavis;5;This recipe is easy and yummy. I use these for breakfast. Once the polenta has cooled I cut with a round cookie cutter, freeze, thaw and brown in skillet as needed.
1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;teleboy20;5;Good recipe for basic polenta. Although a little vague, technically it is correct. Polenta refers to coarse-ground yellow cornmeal or the finished product.
1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;cookies;3;"The instructions are not very clear and may confuse some people...""Polenta"" is the finished meal...""Corn Meal"" is the ingredient that is needed to make POLENTA., also I use 2 cups of cold water to 1 cup of cornmeal for a thicker polenta. To diminish any concerns of lumps, just add some corn meal to cold water, stir then add it to the boiling water and stir constantly."
1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;chrissyweldonbarbusca;5;In Romania, this is not cooked quite as long as this recipe says, and it is called mamaliga. We serve it with sour cream and/or feta-style salty cheese on top. It really is this simple, and it is a nice (and quicker) alternative to mashed potatoes.
1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;ben;5;I agree with italiangirl that this needs less water - you just need to cut the heat when you put in the cornmeal. I took it a step further and put in about an eighth cup chopped up sundried tomato and about 3 TBSP prepared jar pesto. (I got the cheap stuff for $2.00 at Wally World). Some people may need salt, but it tasted just fine. Turned it our into an 8x8 pan to cool so it would have some shape. I was trying to come up with a way to make it into a tube (cylinder), similar to what is sold in the store, but nothing really fit the bill.
1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;soccerplayr9999;5;"Very easy, but I only had to cook it for about 5 minutes until it was THICK. I used Quaker Yellow Cornmeal (Enriched and Degerminated)- I wonder if this is ""quick cooking"" polenta? Either way, it turned out good- I'm excited to fry some tomorrow!"
1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;appia9;5;I've made polenta all my life and have never had it take that long to cook -- usually only a few minutes before it thickens up. It helps eliminate lumps if you mix your cornmeal to a cup of cold water, then add that to boiling water. Great with pesto, tomato and sausage.
1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;nicolecaemcinerney;5;perfect base polenta.....smooth and creamy

1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;amanda;5;I love polenta! The only difference is my great aunt uses 2 cups cold water to every 1 cup cornmeal. It makes a very firm polenta. This is the way I prefer it since I grew up with it this way. She only serves it with a red (tomato based) gravy but it is also good as a side dish to pot roast with beef gravy.
1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;sunflower;5;Thanks for the basic directions! I made polenta for the first time today and I found it very easy to prepare. Just follow these intructions to the t!

1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;kitla;5;Hey! It works! Cool! I added chopped sun-dried tomatoes, a little of their oil, let it cool on plastic wrap, rolled it, tossed it in the fridge for a while then sliced it, fried it and used it with the morrocan chicken recipe from this site. Next time, I'll try parm & basil and put a nice red sauce over it. Thanks so much, this has added a nice starch to my side dish recipes and staples.
1e979018-78f0-43ad-8143-887d791af239;juliecowen;5;Thanks very much for the recipe. Now I can make my own polenta at home without having to try to find it in my grocery store, and it tastes so much better! Thanks again!
0aab8757-4f02-4014-af1e-ff33f8ef20b3;janyoungknowles;4;Used a mix of whole wheat flour and oats instead of white flour. Increased sweetness to 3 tbsp. Splenda. Cut butter to 3 tbsp. and added 1/4 cup of applesauce. Last, used buttermilk instead of skim milk. They were very good!

0aab8757-4f02-4014-af1e-ff33f8ef20b3;barb;4;I made this (at the B&B) when a guest said he was coming in and is a type 1 diabetic. I always make mini-muffins. I asked several questions and made a few changes - I used butter rather than margarine, increased the apple and used a combination of Fuji and Gravenstein (picked fresh from the tree), I added a touch of fresh ginger and used brown sugar instead of the Stevia. Because one batch actually makes 3-4 batches of 8-12 mini muffins, I found each quarter batch freezes well also. When I serve for non-diabetics (most of the time) I sprinkle it with a modified streusel before it goes in the oven - flour, cinnamon and brown sugar (no butter, so I can keep it in the pantry).

f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;sara;5;This is a great basic quinoa porridge recipe, I find others get the cook times a little wrong or add unnecessary steps like cooking the quinoa by itself first. Since I try to reduce added sugar, I like to dice up an apple in place of the brown sugar. I also like adding cardamom in with the cinnamon. This is perfect if you crave the comfort of oatmeal but want something a little heartier.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;brittneeshepherd;5;This was amazing! I used full fat coconut milk because im trying to get more fats in my diet and I used liquid vanilla stevia drops to flavor it instead of brown sugar. I also covered the quinoa when cooking. I topped it off with some delicious blackberries and raspberries when it was done.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;naynay3;2;I love oatmeal, but did not like this. The texture is off and I don't think adding salt is a good idea! I did cook it with the lid on and used slightly less liquid as others recommended, and I do think that helped, but it was still not as good as regular oatmeal. In the end, I added walnuts, banana, and raisins and my fiancé and I were able to finish it all, but I will not be making this again.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;pinkfireball21;5;I've made this two ways and both are excellent. I've made the recipe as written, except covered the pot while it simmers for 20 minutes. The second way is my preferred way. I substitute one mashed banana in place of the brown sugar. This adds just the right amount of sweetness for me! I also still cover the pot while it simmers. One note with the banana is that it usually will take 25 minutes because it does have more liquid in it. Enjoy!
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;heatherpulley;4;OK, so you put twice the amount of liquid as quinoa to cook it properly. The way this is written, with 2 cups of liquid, would mean using 1 cup of quinoa. If you increase to 1 cup you should be fine. I enjoyed this, though reduced to 1 serving so used 1/4 cup quinoa with 1/2 cup almond milk to cook it. You do need to cover it, and it should take about 15 minutes. I also didn't toast it first but just added cinnamon to taste at the end and used 1/2 tsp brown sugar, which made it nicely sweet. I liked this. May add a little dollop of plain Greek yogurt to the top next time, but otherwise it's pretty good!
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;jessicalane;3;The recipe itself is delicious but the recipe directions leave out a lot of steps if this is your first time making quinoa. Make sure to rinse quinoa there is a taste difference if you don't. Add oil to the pan before adding the quinoa otherwise it burns. I did use all the liquid called for because quinoa is a 1:2 ratio. The time frame isn't accurate. It takes about 30-45 mins if you want it to come out soft and not hard using the milk. I tried it with just water that way was faster because for milk you need it on low heat not medium whereas with the water you can do a higher heat. But this taste a lot better with the milk. I throw in a dried fruit near the end to let it get a little warm too.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;ebazinet;5;This is the RIGHT amount of liquid if you want a porridge texture! I followed review suggestions and only used 1c of almond milk...the quinoa was still crunchy. I then added another half c of almond milk and the water, let it simmer, and it was exactly what I was looking for! When I poured the hot porridge into a closed travel container, it absorbed even more liquid and had a mushy consistency (not what I was looking for but oh well). Cooking time was consistent with what the recipe said. I added a banana instead of using brown sugar, and I forgot to add the vanilla, but this is a healthy alternative to oatmeal!
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;hannahpratt;5;I've made this three times each time makes about 2 or 3 servings for me. I dont add any water just the almond milk and a little less brown sugar. Soooooo good highly recommend putting maple syrup, coconut chips, pecans, and some fruit on it!!!
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;debbieeckstein;4;i do NOT like quinoa. tried it everywhich way and still not a fan. however...i LOVE hot cereals, so i was happy and excited to try this, for our Canadian Allstar breakfast challenge. i didn't have almond milk, i used 1%, i also use homemade pumpkin pie spice instead of cinammon. i topped mine with toasted walnuts, blackberries and a drizzle of maple syrup. what i learned from this recipe is that i still don't like quinoa, no matter how you dress it up. So to be fair to the submitter, i'm giving this 4 stars. just because i don't like it, doesn't mean everybody won't like it. i can see how quinoa lovers will really like this recipe. it's just not for me.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;ireney;4;I used 1/2 the amount of brown sugar and added cranberries and almonds. After reading some of the reviews, I started off with 1/2 the liquids, but eventually added more (not the full amounts though). I think that it would have been nicer if I'd added a tad more milk at the end. Overall, a good belly-warming brekkie.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;nw1508;5;Best quinoa porridge I've ever made. Substituted the brown sugar for maple syrup. Added sultanas, cashews and almonds and topped with sunflower seeds for the extra protein hit! So good.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;gabriellen;1;Mine burned instantly.I found it best to heat the milk (and water, if you feel you need it) slowly, stirring constantly, on low heat. Then adding the dried quinoa and other ingredients. Bringing it to a light boil, and lowering the heat to let it simmer with the saucepan lid on it. I didn't find I needed much more liquid than 1 1/2 cups milk, so I didn't add the water.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;marcierb;5;Love this recipe! I like that quinoa has more texture than oats. Berries and dried fruit go great with this.

f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;brykate;4;Very dense. Best mixed with cooked oatmeal too. 1 cup milk was not enough liquid, or that could be because I kept lifting the lid to check it and stir. Used 1/2 c hot water also. Quite sweet, doesn't need much brown sugar cooked into it.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;largesse;5;Great breakfast cereal! Per others' suggestions, I reduced the liquid (to 3/4 c almond milk and 1/4 c water) to make a thicker porridge. The volume of the porridge is then greatly reduced, as others observed, and I'd say it becomes more like 1 serving than 3. I omitted the salt to reduce sodium. The only change I will make for personal taste is to reduce the brown sugar. Very nice recipe, thanks!
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;hrh2019;4;Love this recipe, easy to make and oh so filling. I did reduce the volume of almond milk and water to half a cup each. It came out lovely and fluffy. Superb
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;deepeteo;5;Very good high protein breakfast recipe. The last 30 seconds of cooking I added what I had on hand, raw almonds, golden raisins, dried cranberries and fresh blueberries. I mixed in 2 TBS of ground flax just before serving. I've made lots of recipes using quinoa and knew this wasn't meant to come out light and fluffy like regular dishes. I took it off the heat sooner than 25 minutes while it was still a little watery, and it thickened upon standing. It was perfect. My husband and I thought this was a bit too sweet though. Next time I will leave out the brown sugar and we can stir our own amounts to taste, if needed after serving. This recipe is a keeper and I'll make it again.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;bubblegumaddikt;4;Delicious! However, it was very sweet for me. I made a double batch and tweaked it a little. I used 2 cups quinoa + 1 cup unsweetened almond milk and no water (except for a few tsp when it started to get too thick). Used about 1.5 tbsp brown sugar. Covered with a lid. Added cranberries at the end. Either it was the almond milk or brown sugar and the cranberries that made it too sweet. I will use the almond milk + water next time to see if that makes a difference. If you want it healthier, use less sugar. Just a side note - I've only made quinoa twice now but I think this time the quinoa didn't plump up as much as it did when I made it with broth. P.S. I didn't burn the pan! I will certainly make it again!
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;awebbchic;5;I am always looking for healthy meal options. I was excited when I came across this one because quinoa is a great alternative to many grains. I made this the first time exactly as the recipe stated. It was good but the nutty flavor was a bit overwhelming for me. So, the second time I used half vanilla soy milk and half almond milk. I also used 1 tablespoon of cinnamon instead of 1/4 tsp. I topped the porridge with some walnuts and raisins. It was just right! I make a full batch and divide it into 1 cup servings. I refrigerate the second serving and reheat it the next morning with a little added soy milk and it is great!
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;elizabethmilesbryson;4;This was my first attempt at quinoa for breakfast and it was pretty good. A little sweet for our taste so next time I will use less sugar.

f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;jess;4;I added an additional 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and omitted the vanilla. I also used 1 cup milk, no water. Next time I will reduce the brown sugar a bit as it was a tad sweet. Overall very good. Will make again.

I rinsed the quinoa as per packet instructions, then put on a hot pan with some cinnamon, heated and stirred for about 4 mins until the excess water had evapourated and the quinoa was just about sticking to the pan. I stuck to the 2:1 ratio but used mostly almond milk and a small bit of water, brought it to the boil then turned to lowest heat, and left UNCOVERED to simmer. After 15 mins nearly all the water was gone so I snuck a taste and it was still very crunchy and I was busy with something else so I took it off the heat and covered it and just left it there for about 5 mins. I tasted again, and it was perfect. Just a tiny crunch but with a lovely sticky/stodgy consistency of porridge which I love but this is a great healthier alternative. I added a tiny bit of yoghurt and berry smoothie I had just made up, to sweeten. Lovely, and very filling. I would say the result just varies by quality of quinoa you have and the heat of your cooker top and if it doesn't work first time, try again, it's worth it.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;hlm286;5;Quinoa is known as a superfood so I was trying to find a recipe for quinoa for breakfast and this recipe is just what I was looking for! I left out the brown sugar and added it on top after it was cooked. It made two servings so I put one in the fridge to heat up for tomorrow's breakfast. Delicious and so healthy! Thanks!
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;1meech;4;Delicious recipe. I followed one other reviewer's recommendation and used 1 cup almond milk (vanilla, unsweetened). After the quinoa boiled I reduced to a simmer and covered until cooked (about 20 minutes). I also added some raisins after cooking and it was a delicious breakfast!
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;rebeckygurl;5;This was very tasty! I have just been introduced to quinoa, and this is my first breakfast use of it. It has just the right amount of sweetness and is quite filling. I made it with regular milk, since that's what i had, but i added some almond extract. Yum!
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;foxhoundqueen;5;"This recipe was fantastic with just a few minor adjustments; first of all, I used unsweetened chocolate almond milk since that's what I had on hand and it was delicious! Also, I didn't bother with water and used almond milk as my liquid exclusively, sticking to the quinoa package's recommended 2:1 ratio of liquid to grain instead of what's written here and it was absolutely perfect. This is a great, delicious, healthy breakfast if you have the time to make it!"
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;getwet;4;Does anyone know if you can make this the night before and re-heat in the morning? I don't have that much time in the morning to make this, but would love get started on my bag of quinoa I have had in my pantry for so long and been too scared to cook with it.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;vtmemebear;5;I prepared this the way LUV2COOK recommended and it came out perfect. I've never cooked Quinoa before and I love the nutty flavor and slightly crunchy texture of it. I used maple syrup to sweeten it and added a little nutmeg then mixed in some banana. I've also added apple pie spice or pumpkin pie spice to my cereal before.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;stephanie;4;This was really good and an interesting new way to use quinoa but some changes were needed in the cooking method. I did not add the water and just used 1.5 cups soy milk since that seemed like way too much liquid from my previous experiences with quinoa (figured I could add the water later if it was needed- it wasn't). I also covered the pan while it was simmering to help with water absorption. After the quinoa was cooked through I took off the lid and simmered until it reached the consistency I wanted. I topped with a bit more brown sugar and some walnuts. This made a delicious breakfast for two (it was not three servings for us) and I think we both could have eaten a bit more.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;fastcookin44;5;This was great! What a great change for breakfast! Made exactly as stated except for I added a tad less water. Thanks! Excellent!
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;anjee67980;5;First dish I have made using Quinoa and it turned out great! I added a little more brown sugar.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;lauren;4;very tasty. much better than oatmeal!
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;joydauterman;5;I thought this was a terrific quinoa recipe. I bought a large bag at Costco's so I'm always looking for ways to use it. I made it just as written except for using skim milk and it came out fine. I split it into 3 1/2-cup servings to reheat during the week. I will try adding the raisins, craisins and/or nuts when I have it next. Yum!
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;debbiewallis;5;This is really a delicious healthy recipe! It takes a few minutes to do but is well worth it! You can just let it cook as you do other things around and occassionally check on it and stir it. I do it with a little maple syrup in place of the brown sugar. I've also started adding some nuts on top that I've roasted in my oven for 7-8 min. on 350. It's really good and satisfying knowing that it's also healthy and high protein. It's a staple breakfast recipe for me now! Thanks for shareing!!
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;p24fergus;4;Tasty!
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;monstrmomi;1;Did not have good flavor and took too long to cook. I have made something similar in the crockpot over night and I think I like the flavor better.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;kathyhaley;4;Thanks for this great recipe! I substituted stevia drops for the brown sugar and it still was a fabulous, creative, satisfying start to my day.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;ceresblossom;3;A bit too crunchy for my liking, even though I did not expect this to be smooth. The taste was ok though. It was my second time with quinoa and I think I'll explore other ways to use it.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;smilelovely;3;It's pretty good. I took the advice of another poster and used 1/2 c water and 1/2 c milk (used vanilla almond milk). No sugar added since I haven't got any and I was making this in my dorm. The quinoa cooked well but was nothing like porridge afterward. I mixed it with blackberries to get some sweetness in and added a tiny bit more milk to it for another bit of sweetness. I'll probably make this again and try using a bit more liquid from the start.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;mk;3;This was good but not out of this world. I used regular milk as I only had that, and decreased it to about 1/2 c as others suggested. It didn't need the full 25 min, but it probably took about 20. I omited the salt as well. This only made 2 portions, and that is coming from a light eater. I will make it again but I think I want to play around with it to make it REALLY good.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;laneibrown;2;Maybe it's just quinoa I don't like but I couldn't get this stuff to taste good. Too sweet, too bitter.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;sooperlowa;5;My daughter made this for my b-day breakfast and I thought it was wonderful. We used soymilk but otherwise followed the recipe. YUM!
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;vmartires;4;Made in a ricecooker, with slightly less liquid (only 1 1/2 cups total). Used soy milk instead of almond milk, and 1 1/2 tbsps agave nectar instead of the brown sugar. Turned out perfect. Exactly like the porridge served on the Inca Trail in Peru. Great alternative to porridge oats.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;ricelover;4;Very excellent! This is my 2nd time cooking with Quinoa and I really liked this! I added a lot more cinnamon, used cows milk, and did not add as much water. I also added raisins and it tasted fabulous. I think I've found an alternative to salty breakfast sandwiches on Sunday morning before church!
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;luv2cook;3;This recipe has way too much liquid, maybe that's why several people thought theirs wasn't cooked in the time specified. If you're expecting this recipe to soak up all the liquid like oatmeal does, you'll be disappointed. The quinoa I bought (Costco) is pre-rinsed, and the cooking instructions on it are to use 1 part quinoa to 2 parts liquid, brown it in butter or oil, then add liquid, bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer for 15 min. I have substituted several different liquids, and it always turns out perfect and fluffy like rice. So, I still gave this 3 stars, because after I altered the liquid amounts to 1/2 c water and 1/2 c almond milk, it did turn out quite nice. I like it with chopped almonds and dried cranberries mixed in at the end for breakfast.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;jamiemartinez;5;This was REALLY good! I used plain unsweetened soy milk because I ran out of almond milk and my kids ate every last bite. Next time I will use almond milk to see which I like better. Definitely a keeper!
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;nurseellensonota;5;Loved this! The only change I made was to use regular milk. It was such a nice change for breakfast. Next time I will add raisins or craisins.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;dianne;4;This is a great way to get protein in the morning because it's disguised as carbs! I noticed that some people had trouble with this recipe and I think it helps immensely to COVER the saucepan. I always put a lid on when I'm cooking quinoa, so that's what I did with this recipe. The quinoa was done after about 20 minutes, I then uncovered it and let the extra liquid cook off until I had my desired consistency. Came out perfect! I recently switched to (unsweetened) almond milk so I was excited to see a recipe that called for it. Loved the cinnamon and vanilla. I added some raisins and craisins and sprinkled some extra brown sugar on top. Yum! ****Update: I now make this with only 1 cup of milk and no water. Cover and simmer, and it only takes about 10-15 min. to cook.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;christinem;5;I was a little apprehensive to try this due to some of the not-so-glowing reviews, but I finally did and am very happy I did! Only change was to use regular skim milk, and the cooking time was off - I had to simmer for about another 20 minutes, adding about an additional 1/4 cup of water to keep from burning, but the end result was excellent! Served with some fresh blueberries.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;poshdee;1;This recipe looked so promising. I love quinoa, which I eat a few times a week, and like almond milk as well, often using it in porridge. But ugh, this recipe is revolting. Maybe the original poster used unsweetened almond milk, and mine was sweetened (the only kind you can buy in the UK, to my knowledge). But it was so sickly sweet that I couldn't eat it. Plus the texture and colour were offputting too. I won't be making this again.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;tikay36;4;I love quinoa but had never considered using it in a sweet breakfast dish before seeing this recipe! As noted in some other reviews this does take forevvver to cook which sucked because my guest and I were super hungry, but with the addition of some cinnamon cereal and blueberry jam, it was worth the wait. Really delicious, filling, and satisfying! My only suggestion would be to cook it at a higher temperature for a shorter amount of time BUT be sure to continue stirring it the whole time.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;blkbtrfly01;5;I LOVE this recipe. It's a great way to start the day. I am an oatmeal fan and find this cereal to be lighter than oatmeal yet just as filling. I add cinnamon, nutmeg, craisens, and vanilla, and cook it in soy milk. Once cooked, I add a scoop of ground flaxseed. Yum!
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;larkspur;5;"This was a delicious and very healthy breakfast! I used regular cows milk, because I didn't have almond. I also used organic raw brown sugar (sucanat) instead of regular. I cut it down to one serving size; it wasn't really enough, though! Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe!"
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;xzigalia;2;I followed the instructions as directed, but used red quinoa, raw milk and raw honey instead of the plain quinoa, almond milk and brown sugar. Becuae I used a darker quinoa it was difficult to tell when it was toasted. To me it tasted slightly burnt but having never had quinoa before I don't know if that was its natural taste. My main problem is it would not break down and thicken. I cooked it for an hour, the milk boiled right down and the grains became tender but the texture was still seeds floating in milk. After an hour I tried getting creative, boiling it again, microwaving it, squashing it with a spoon and yelling at it. After an hour and a half I gave up and ate as is. It was very tasty but never got to the consistency of porridge.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;travelingfool;4;OK- I made this porridge this morning with a few revisions. I added one chopped apple, a handful or raisins, and some baking sweetener to 1C of the quinoa. I used one of those waterless cooker pans from the 70s so the porridge cooked in 30 minutes but it required nearly double the fluid. I used one Cup of skim milk and all the rest in water. If I had cider in the house I would have used that. The end result is tasty. I am trying to add more whole grains to our diets. My husband will eat quinoa with a tomato creole type addition but he isn't thrilled. The porridge is for me!!
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;werethylacine;4;This was my first experience with quinoa, and quite positive. I think this recipe is delicious, though does need to be cooked longer. I used 1% milk instead of almond-- watch out for the milk protein scum, which needs to be skimmed off. I'd make this again, but I'm going to keep looking for a breakfast quinoa recipe that'll fit into my morning schedule during the school year.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;jessica;4;this was really really good. it had the perfect amount of sweetness. it had a tiny bit of a crunch, but it wasnt really crunchy like it sounded like everyone else's was. i cooked it longer than 25 minutes only because i wanted it to be thicker. i cooked it at a very low simmer for 25 minutes, and the texture was great.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;amy;2;I followed this recipe to the letter, but at 25min, my quinoa was still quite crunchy. I bumped the heat up to medium low. After over an hour, I gave up, doused my serving with brown sugar, and managed to eat half of it before dumping the rest down the drain. Ah well. I'm afraid I won't be trying this one again.
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;sai;4;"I made this for my family, as I'm a big ""You are what you eat"" fan, and this is one of the ingredients suggested by Gillian. I was surprised that such a healthy ingredient tasted good. I won't be a fan of quinoa over night, but this definitely opened my mind to using quinoa in some other recipes. When I followed the direction, I found that the quinoa was still a bit crunchy after it was prepared. I don't know if this is common or not, but the next time I make it, I think I will cook it a bit longer. Also, if you are feeding other people with this recipe, it comes out closer to two and a half (very filling) servings. I would suggest that you make this in conjunction with blueberry muffins as the combination of flavors was delicious. Thanks for submitting the recipe!!"
f88b9600-3a5c-4d8e-aa17-9dd5b31799fa;momzillaevin;4;This is SOOOOO good! For health reasons, I have to eat tons of protien every day, and I get sick of stuffing my face with meat all day. This was a very refreshing breakfast, very tasty and different! It's in the 80s here already but this winter, this will be a staple! Next time I'll use less liquid, I like my porridge thick enough to stand a spoon up in it. I added chopped walnuts and dried fruit and a little extra cinnamon. Excellent!

Easy enough. I added a teaspoon of salt. Next time I will probably try it with half apple cider vinegar, half white vinega, and only 1tsp of oregano. This is a delicious low, low calorie slaw substitute.

c33e281f-9b66-45fb-ad31-0f3290011164;lou;5;I love pupusa. I love curtido. I love pupusa with curtido. But I love curtido even more, I could eat a whole jar by itself just fine. Thanks for sharing this easy recipe. I often find mold growing in the curtido jar at a pupusa restaurant near my house. Ever since, I want to learn how to make it clean. I didn't have green onions and Mexican oregano. I rehydrated my very old oregano in half cup of water before mix with blanched cabbages. Yum.
c33e281f-9b66-45fb-ad31-0f3290011164;franktoy;2;The vinegar taste was overwhelming. This recipe was simple and quick to make, but all I could taste was the vinegar, even when paired with the pupusas. I wouldn't make this recipe again.
c33e281f-9b66-45fb-ad31-0f3290011164;pvfan;5;I made this to serve as a healthy coleslaw type salad since it didn't include mayo or oil. Love that it is so healthy and yet so flavorful! Used chives from the garden because I didn't have green onions, and added some salt and pepper, but otherwise, stuck to the recipe. Steeping it in boiling water for a few minutes does something to the texture that we really like without making it even a little soggy. Thanks for sharing!
c33e281f-9b66-45fb-ad31-0f3290011164;joemamma;5;i'm not from el salvador, and i haven't tried a lot of different curtidos but i can say this is just like any other i have gotten from a restaurant or friend. very simple to make and tastes great. like many others wrote, i only used 1/2 the amount of oregano specified. it maybe could have used another pinch or so but i didn't want to take it too far. we had it with fajitas and everyone enjoyed it! it makes a lot too, i actually only used about 1/4 head of cabbage and still have lots left over. no problem though, it goes great with lots of stuff!
c33e281f-9b66-45fb-ad31-0f3290011164;bryanthayward;5;I can't wait to try this. But I believe I'll be adding some crushed red pepper to give it some kick. The Salvadoran restaurant where I first enjoyed this delicious slaw had huge jars of it in the tables. Also, it was spicy (not just vinegary), and the perfect complement to my amazing pupusas! ??
c33e281f-9b66-45fb-ad31-0f3290011164;justjam;4;i used this as a starting point to make a vinegary latiny cole slaw.. just added some season salt, garlic powder, and extra vinegar.. i only used 1 tsp of oregano (Mexican) and it that was plenty.. ty for the starting point for my side dish :) ~~UPDATE: cilantro is also good in oregano's place.. so good!
c33e281f-9b66-45fb-ad31-0f3290011164;ptulip;5;Curtido (cabbage slaw) is a great light alternative to the mayo based Slaw. I travel to El Salvador quite allot and absolutely love the pupas with this slaw and tomato sauce on side. But I made this slaw to go along with my pulled pork sandwiches. I did add 1/2diced jalapeño to spice up. Mexican oregano is more pungent which Is okay with me. It's a preference
c33e281f-9b66-45fb-ad31-0f3290011164;slfortson;3;"I've only had curtido once years ago, so I don't remember what it's actually ""supposed"" to taste like, but my half Salvadorian son was begging for pupusas, so I gave it a try. I followed this recipe exactly, and I also prepped it the day before for maximum flavor. My biggest comment is that the oregano was very overpowering, but maybe it is supposed to be that way. Overall, it was ok, but I wasn't overly impressed."
c33e281f-9b66-45fb-ad31-0f3290011164;lunita777;4;I use 1/2 white vinegar & 1/2 apple cider vinegar. Red onion instead of green onions & a couple of jalepeno peppers cut in 1/2 in the jar. The longer it sits the better it is. A thin sauce of pureed tomatoe spiced hot or mild to taste. Sauce on the pupusas, then curtido. We use curtido instead of regular cole-slaw its addictive.
c33e281f-9b66-45fb-ad31-0f3290011164;bigdaddy;3;I think 2 tsp oregano is WAY too much
c33e281f-9b66-45fb-ad31-0f3290011164;karlovsky;5;It was super easy to make and delicious. I opted to add some tomato sauce for a bit of color, as I am use to have curtido with a bit of tomato here in Los Angeles.

c33e281f-9b66-45fb-ad31-0f3290011164;ashleykr;5;Deliciously simple! I love this recipe, but I always add a fresh pureed tomato, too, right before tossing together all the ingredients. It adds another layer of flavor that I just can't do without.
c33e281f-9b66-45fb-ad31-0f3290011164;amybobamy;4;I suggest that you use MUCH less oregano than called for. I used top quality Mexican oregano, and the flavor was overpowering. Otherwise, a terrific recipe.
c33e281f-9b66-45fb-ad31-0f3290011164;mnbrogers;4;I made this specifically for Pupusas. Alone, I am not a big fan but, pair it with pupusas and it is awesome. I followed the directions as written (here is the but...) but, doubled the recipe. My husband thought it tasted better than the stuff we got at the El Salvadoran restaurant.
c33e281f-9b66-45fb-ad31-0f3290011164;kristy;5;This was excellent with fish tacos but it makes me wish we had a place around here to get pupusas. I don't know how to make them and I have a feeling it's one of those things that looks easier than it really is.
c33e281f-9b66-45fb-ad31-0f3290011164;june;5;A excellent recipe I love curtido so yummy with the papusa's. I did use Mexican Oregano as it gives a much stronger flavor that is just my preferance. This also made a wonderful stuffing for my vegetarian tacos and burrritos. As for the food police comments here it does not matter how one likes to eat their curtido, whether it be stuffed inside, thrown on the top, eaten with hands,fork and a knife ect.. just friggin enjoy this wonderful delicious recipe so gracefully supplied by a lovely member.
c33e281f-9b66-45fb-ad31-0f3290011164;jessicav;5;Pretty good recipe, I add less vinegar for personal taste and add a pinch of salt and pepper. I put this slaw on top of flat crunchy tortillas with mince meat, a slice of boiled egg and grated white hard cheese. Delicious!

c33e281f-9b66-45fb-ad31-0f3290011164;latinacook;5;I agree with T.L. Curtido doesn't go inside the pupusas. It is served on the side. I like to cut up the pupusa and have some of the curtido (and tomato sauce) with each bite of the pupusa. Most of my friends puree a couple of roma tomatoes by themselves and use that as the tomato sauce that is usually served with pupusas. The sauce can be pretty bland as is but the curtido has strong flavors, therefore, the bland tomato puree kind of mellows it out. Talking about strong flavors, I don't use quite as much vinegar for the curtido as a personal preference. However, the amount stated in this recipe is right and it yields a very authentic curtido. It is supposed to taste vinegary.
c33e281f-9b66-45fb-ad31-0f3290011164;tl;5;The recipe is fine, but the description is not accurate. Curtido does not go inside of pupusas. It's served on the side after the pupusas are cooked. One should open the pupusa to expose the cheese (and/or beans/pork, etc.) This helps to cool it off. Then one should rip off a bite size piece of the pupusa and pinch a bite of curtido into that piece before eating. Some also like to pour salsa on top of the curtido before eating.

The only change I made to the recipe, other than soaking the flowers overnight after boiling, was that I added chopped cilantro to the saute. So easy to keep vegan or add a crumble of cotija or some crema de avocado. I served this to a large group, including Mexican nationals, vegans and meat eaters and EVERYONE LOVED IT! So simple, so perfect and stunningly delicious.
d0b91e44-66c3-47c9-973f-bfe21caddf59;jackiiecano;5;This is a really and tasty recipe! My only suggestion is to let the hibiscus soak the night before and then boil. This will allow it to have a softer texture. You can use the juice that extracted to make Jamaica water.
335b1257-a06f-4be6-8337-fdca8616201f;bethanyszczepanski;5;Tried my first dandelion salad last night and won't be the last! I combined this with another recipe, adding mango and strawberry to balance sweet and bitter. Also added feta, sunflower seeds, quinoa, and black beans to make it a full meal. delicious!
335b1257-a06f-4be6-8337-fdca8616201f;juanpellegrini;5;The argentinean style, as a side of a good argentinean bbq. Salt, oil(sunflower oil) vinegar(any kind you like, or even lemon juice) and lots lots of fresh chopped garlic! No wonder it is so hard to kill, Dandelions are a great source of vitamins and minerals too ! Yes, again lots of garlic, and do no speak too close to people that didn’t eat the salad. (Just chew a coffee bean afterwards)
335b1257-a06f-4be6-8337-fdca8616201f;tetianapashutynska;4;I added olive oil to your recipe. Tastes good!
335b1257-a06f-4be6-8337-fdca8616201f;davidwasson;5;When I was in my late teens, I remember my mother used to take a green plastic colander out into the back yard and come back with it full of the dandelion greens. And, with the simple addition of some tomato, cucumber, and onion, she made a top grade salad. She made her own sweet and sour type dressing for it and it was delicious. And so I have tried this recipe. And it is also delicious, and brought back memories.
335b1257-a06f-4be6-8337-fdca8616201f;ginamengelke;4;"I got these greens in an organic produce delivery -- wasn't quite sure how to serve. I used the red onion I had, then fried up some prosciutto to make it crisp and used Marie's Blue Cheese Vinaigrette (available in the refrigerated produced section of your grocery store). Having a dressing that's a little sweet helps balance out the bitterness of the greens and the salty prosciutto added crunch as well as balancing the ""salty sweet"" taste to the salad."
335b1257-a06f-4be6-8337-fdca8616201f;cheri;5;I have not tried this recipe, but it sounds delicious. Also, as a reminder, not to be facetious, but those of you who treat your lawns with chemicals, do not use dandelion greens from your lawn. Chemical lawn treatments are toxic!
335b1257-a06f-4be6-8337-fdca8616201f;toshiba;5;If you don't pick these right when they spring up out of the ground they will be bitter. You have to pick 'em fresh for the sweet taste.
335b1257-a06f-4be6-8337-fdca8616201f;angiedyer;4;Very bitter greens but was great with a hot bacon dressing, I will offset this next time with adding spinach, fruit, and nuts.
335b1257-a06f-4be6-8337-fdca8616201f;ttv78;5;I love a simple green salad that allows the flavor of the greens to stand out on their own. I love dandelion greens (they're not for everyone!) & simply adding the onions & tomatoes are more than enough to make a delicious salad. The dried basil is a nice touch and a great subtle flavor addition. I enjoyed this with my own simple balsamic vinaigrette dressing recipe & it hit the spot. If you want to help tone down the bitter flavor of the dandelion greens, just soak them in some salted cold water for 5-10 minutes. Then drain & dry before making the salad. Thanks for sharing this recipe! :)
335b1257-a06f-4be6-8337-fdca8616201f;lindamcmullen;4;All I can say to those who tried this and found it bitter, is that the greens have to be young, first growing, perhaps before the bud shows...... Great recipe, thank you.
335b1257-a06f-4be6-8337-fdca8616201f;maryljohnson;4;"Brought back great memories of my Italian father picking dandelions from the yard! He would saute' in olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper. I thought it was so weird to eat ""weeds"" but through him I learned to love them!"
335b1257-a06f-4be6-8337-fdca8616201f;dinnerdiva;1;I've tried to eat dandelions over and over again - I kept thinking I must be doing something wrong. I first ate them as a child when my mom would pick them from very young plants and make a salad similar to this but with oil and vinegar dressing. I didn't like it then and I still don't care for it. Darn things are bitter. I know, they're good for you - but you have to eat them to get the benefit of that goodness and I just can't. Sorry. At least I gave it one star - for the memories. My mom kept a basket and a knife in the trunk of the car and would stop and pick dandelions from farmers fields when she was out in the country - she thought they were a big prize! This was back in the middle ages - in the 1950's and 60's!
335b1257-a06f-4be6-8337-fdca8616201f;millie;5;"This brought back memories of my childhood when Mom and Dad would go to the woods to pick wild greens--nothing better! I still long for that taste. Mom would cook them in some water and add bacon grease. Yummy! I remember dandelion and sour dock being some of the ""weeds""they picked. We would also sprinkle our serving with a little vinegar."
335b1257-a06f-4be6-8337-fdca8616201f;cookinforcash;5;This simple recipe is great - I grew up eatting dandelion salad. I slice the onions instead of chopping, and don't add the dried basil. Crumbled feta and a simple dressing of EVOO and balsamic or red wine vinegar go well with this. Tender young greens from your yard or farmer's market are way better than the huge ones sold in stores.
335b1257-a06f-4be6-8337-fdca8616201f;magoulianitissa;5;Thank you for this very tasty salad. In my country we love dandelions. We mostly boil them lightly and eat them with lemon juice and olive oil as a salad. They go very well with fryed fish or with barbequed meat.
335b1257-a06f-4be6-8337-fdca8616201f;rudyhawes;5;Just remember you must harvest the greens before they blossom or the greens will be bitter!!!!!!

335b1257-a06f-4be6-8337-fdca8616201f;inounvme;5;I really liked this especially with the addition of mango and crumbled blue cheese.
335b1257-a06f-4be6-8337-fdca8616201f;shanda;5;Thought it was great! Made it just as recomended. But the mangos and pine nuts with gorgonzola sound great! I will try that next time. Never have liked dandelion's before but made sure I picked only the very young tender ones. They were not bitter at all, whole family liked it and could not believe it was dandelions. We will definitely make it again.
335b1257-a06f-4be6-8337-fdca8616201f;ladyjaypee;4;I had never eaten dandelion greens before, but on the advice of my brother who is an EXcellent cook, I went for it. I jazzed it up quite a bit because I had heard the greens can taste bitter. So I used grape tomato halves, tossed in some sweet fresh diced mango to complement any bitterness, added some toasted pinenuts, crumbled gorgonzola, & did a simple balsamic/olive oil dressing. It was deLICious! Thanks, John!
335b1257-a06f-4be6-8337-fdca8616201f;lindamclean;5;"I grew up eating this salad; I loved it then and I love it now. My mom would get up early in the morning to pick the tender leaves from the backyard. She would then make a sweet warm bacon dressing that did a nice job of offsetting the slight bitter flavor of the greens. Thanks John, good stuff!"

1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;lorilohrenz;5;I made this with fresh cooked beets and dijon mustard and it was delicious. Perfect for making ahead, as it keeps great in the refrigerator for a week or more. Now making my second batch to take to a picnic later this week!
1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;elizabeth;3;These were ok. They just tasted like sweeter beets with onions. Wouldn't make again.
1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;nana247;5;Still cooling but flavor is just what I was looking for. I did not add sugar. Wanting tang, not sweet.
1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;johnh;5;This was delicious and easy. The only change is I used fresh beets rather than canned.
1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;msjean;5;Very good! I cut back a little on the sugar per some of the reviews. Also added a bit of salt and garlic powder. Nice as a side or added to a garden salad. Thanks for the recipe!
1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;hannahsmom;5;Used fresh beets from my Dad’s garden. LOVED this recipe. Next time I will double the vinegar. I’m a vinegar super fan.

1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;aaronshanahan;5;Delicious and simple recipe! My 2yr old loves the marinated beets from the grocery store olive bar and I was looking for something close to that. This recipe does that and it's even better than the grocery store version. I boiled fresh beets and halved the sugar, and I only had apple cider vinegar but it all turned out great. Yum!!
1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;janiscarrigan;5;So simple, and delicious. I did add chopped red onion.

1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;kimthomas;5;This recipe is excellent as is using canned beets. But I tried it fresh beets and it was over the moon terrific! I use two bunches (about 4 -6 medium to large) and double the marinade amounts but not double the onion. I serve chilled on a separate dinner plate with goat cheese sprinkle on top.
1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;barbarajudisch;5;Easy and delish way to dress up canned beets.

1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;dutchredman;5;Perfect beet recipe! My wife never liked beets, but is now a fan. Always have some in the fridge. Usually use four cans and double the marinade. We like sliced beets... lots easier. Thanks for the recipe. It's a keeper.
1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;apple25;5;I had already steamed 4 med beets in my iPot when I came here looking for a marinade for them. The weight came to about 13.5 ounces. I basically followed the recipe, but omitted the onions and used Apple Cider Vinegar instead of the white wine vinegar. Very quick, easy and delicious. Will do this again next time.
1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;flamingonut;4;"I didn't have any WWV, so I used RWV; it was good, but too sweet. Purchased WWV and cut the sugar to 2T, but it still wasn't right.

1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;kaykelly;5;Made this once and have been asked to repeat several times, but have had to double the recipe every time. Reminds me of grandma's pickled beets, but so much easier!
1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;chefbaby;5;I can't say enough about how delicious these marinated beets are. I would love to try them as a salad with blue cheese, cracked pepper, and arugula.
1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;aunte;5;So easy and delicious. Step by step directions are quick and makes for a nice summer salad. Even my nephew who is picky tasted it and said it was ok. So that is a huge compliment. LOL I used yellow onion because that was what I had on hand. The juice was the best part. Mmmm.
1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;oodlesor;5;Sooooo much better than pickled beets in a can. Absolutely delicious and easy to make, just think ahead a little. They are better the longer they marinate.

1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;melody;5;I love this beet salad and have made it quite a few times. The only thing I have changed over time is to make it less sweet. I always make it with a sugar substitute. I have used Sweet n Low and splenda and find it very sweet. It's so easy and I love having it around for a snack.
1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;sarahd;5;Made exactly as written only letting it sit overnight. Was better after sitting out and taking the chill off. And I used sliced canned beets. Will make again. Very good!

1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;jimmyandnancylong;5;Great recipe! Instead of the prepared mustard I used powdered and I added a couple dashes of ground cloves (a tip I learned from the owner of one of our favorite restaurants). So easy, nutritious and delicious! Thanks Myra for sharing!
1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;aubyrd;4;Overall I thought this was very good. I used fresh beets because I had them and Vidalia Onion fresh from the farm. The mustard flavor was a little overpowering, so next time I may reduce it slightly. It did get better with time for all the flavors to mingle. Thanks for this recipe.
1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;ufcjunkie;5;Great recipe, I have multiplied this recipe 30 times to make a huge batch and it comes out great! This is the perfect balance of sweet and tart. Love it!

1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;nikkibach;5;Fantastic! Made just as the recipe called for except I subbed half the sugar for Splenda. Very easy and tasty! Thanks for the recipe! Will make again!

The first time I made it my husband licked the bowl clean! Any substitutions happened after we'd made it ""by the book"" the first time. I did use fresh beets all summer from our CSA, boiling them in their skins and then peeling and slicing them. The most major change I made was adding heaps of fresh dill to the recipe, which my aunt commented on specifically at our summer BBQ (""I never would have thought to add dill, but it's amazing). DISCLAIMER: you have to like dill to add it! LOL. We also added lots of onion, and slices of cucumber and radishes. Sometimes I used jarred mustard and sometimes mustard powder. I reserved a little bit of the beet water when I boiled it, and added that to the vinegar/sugar marinade. Only rule is that you have to refrigerate it for a while to get the full effect. Delicious! Thank you!"
1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;cindy;5;Very good!! I did add some salt and pepper, and used red wine vinegar. We'll do this again - thanks for the recipe!

1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;schoen;5;Very good - better with fresh, roasted beets. I have used slivered fennel instead of onion and have also topped with crumbled feta. Quick, easy & delicious!

1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;luvngrams;5;This is a wonderful recipe. Reminds me of my mothers home made pickled beets. I like this salad chilled instead of room temerature as suggested. I will make this dish for the next outdoor BBQ we attend.
1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;missisb;5;Fantastic recipe and so easy! I am addicted to this and enjoy it often with my lunch sandwich. Great dish to share at a potluck too. Thank you Myra.
1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;dwieberg;5;Easy, great reviews and pretty too. Easy enough for a family dinner and special enough for company. It's a keeper. Sliced canned beets were all I had on hand & worked well chopped.
1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;micke;5;Thank you for this fantastic recipe. Made it for a family gathering and it's already been requested for the next.
1f65bd66-6bda-4818-9471-1a8a0eed3294;debbydradimalloy;5;Great recipe. I served it with a pork roast and it was awesome. Definitly serve at room temperature. I tasted it cold and thought it's alright but when I had it later after sitting out it was ALRIGHT!!!
50514c6e-624d-4cc4-b86e-fbd000e58847;candwich85;4;Good just didn’t seem like it was low in fat
50514c6e-624d-4cc4-b86e-fbd000e58847;niccoledorsey;5;It was delicious and my family enjoyed having something new and low in fat and carbs... I will continue to make this for my family from now on

50514c6e-624d-4cc4-b86e-fbd000e58847;dentyb;4;Wonderful treat, especially when you are tired of eggs every which way. Use a splash of your best Vanilla extract!
50514c6e-624d-4cc4-b86e-fbd000e58847;lildanny;5;"Thank you so much for this recipe! I skipped breakfast today because I was busy shopping. I switched out the egg substitute I found for something I desired for a special occasion happening. It's a long story; but anyway! It's still the best and most simplest French Toast recipe! I can't find much low-fat or low-calorie recipes, so this made my day when I came home and started making it! To me, it tasted just like French Toast! The recipe was enough to cover my bread, thankfully! I would of still added more to cover, but still!"
50514c6e-624d-4cc4-b86e-fbd000e58847;bettyann;5;Amazing and delicious recipe. Mine came out a little soggy but next time I'll remove it from the egg mixture sooner. I can't wait to eat this again!
50514c6e-624d-4cc4-b86e-fbd000e58847;ldyg33k;5;My fiancé and I were wary about a low calorie version of french toast, but I decided to give it a try instead of doing without. Wow! Both of us were foolish for not have trying this sooner! We did make some modifications to the original recipe, but we calculated it out to be about 72 calories per piece. Here are our substitutes: 2 eggs 2/3 cup light Silk soy milk vanilla Nickles 35 calorie wheat bread Please at least give this recipe a fair try if you're looking for a light option.
50514c6e-624d-4cc4-b86e-fbd000e58847;kimime;4;This is typical French Toast. Nothing surprising here. Jazz it up with some orange zest and use more cinnamon.
50514c6e-624d-4cc4-b86e-fbd000e58847;sarahjo;4;I did not have egg substitute, I used one full egg and two egg whites. I also used whole wheat bread. My only issue with this recipe was that it wasn't enough to cover six pieces--it was just enough to cover five. Barely. My kids ate all of it. No complaints here.
50514c6e-624d-4cc4-b86e-fbd000e58847;melissa;5;Delish!! I used whole grain bread. Will make this again.
50514c6e-624d-4cc4-b86e-fbd000e58847;gavigabmom;4;This is a great low calorie options for breakfast. Do not leave the bread in the egg mixture for more than a second to keep it from being soggy.
50514c6e-624d-4cc4-b86e-fbd000e58847;mimi;4;great recipe - I just used double fiber wheat bread - yummmm.....
50514c6e-624d-4cc4-b86e-fbd000e58847;swirlyluv;2;This was the first time I made French Toast (I always opt for lowfat) and it didn't turn out too well. It was way too soggy, and I'm not sure that's how it's supposed to be. I threw away all of it, except for one which I ate. I could taste the vanilla and the texture of the egg substitute. :(
31689d9e-5392-48c3-aea3-64c495cb8f88;theresastringer;2;Too much tangy lemon and vinegar
31689d9e-5392-48c3-aea3-64c495cb8f88;foodie;2;All ingredients sounded good so I was surprised that I didn't like this.
31689d9e-5392-48c3-aea3-64c495cb8f88;faiewinde74;5;I ran out of chili powder and cayenne (WHO DOES THAT) and used only about 4 tablespoons of lime juice, but the recipe still turned out really really yummy! Added a great flavor as a topping to our carne asada.
31689d9e-5392-48c3-aea3-64c495cb8f88;teresa;3;The recipe was good but with some little adjustments, it was fabulous.
31689d9e-5392-48c3-aea3-64c495cb8f88;suzanneschneider;5;I did not have any cilantro or pickled jalapeño. I used diced canned nonpickled jalapeños. Awesome flavors. Everyone loved the extra kick.
31689d9e-5392-48c3-aea3-64c495cb8f88;vern;5;I made this salsa that we even ate as a slaw. The adjustment I made was frozen Green Chili. Frozen green chili allowed me to have control of the level of heat. I only added the cabbage, tomatoes, red onions, cilantro, lemon (we prefer lemon over lime), salt and pepper. It was simple. It made a lot but didn't last long. My family chowed down on it. Some added season salt and garlic powder. My mother in law ate it as it was and LOVED it!
31689d9e-5392-48c3-aea3-64c495cb8f88;bnorton;5;Easy to make and absolutely delicious. Great with any Mexican meal. It is the side that I have been searching for.
31689d9e-5392-48c3-aea3-64c495cb8f88;ttkc;4;Very close to the one we recently enjoyed in a mexican restaurant with chips. We halved the recipe for the 2 of us and used it to top our tacos. Very different and fresh. Still had some left, that I will ude as a side ( like coleslaw) tonight.
31689d9e-5392-48c3-aea3-64c495cb8f88;michellewachobsealey;4;"I made this for the first time this weekend. Reviews were unanimously, ""too tart/sour"" so I added stevia to sweeten and take the tart edge off. I also added a little more salt and pepper. After that the reviews were more along the lines of, ""dreamy"" or ""fabulous!""Keeper."
31689d9e-5392-48c3-aea3-64c495cb8f88;mistystaunton;5;Delicious! I added tortilla chips on top for that extra crunch!
31689d9e-5392-48c3-aea3-64c495cb8f88;nshell;5;This was great! Made as is. The La Costena pickled jalepenos were spot on. We made a huge batch for football on sunday. Originally it was just supposed to be a chips and salsa substitute, but it was so tasty that we also added it as a topping to another authentic spanish rice recipe, and then mixed into carnitas burritos the next day. i will definitely make it again just the way the recipe calls for.
31689d9e-5392-48c3-aea3-64c495cb8f88;volleyballmom;4;Nice change to traditional non-creamy coleslaw. I would have given 5 stars but we all found the lime too overpowering. I had to add a little agave to balance it out. Still a really nice slaw. Served with Mexican pulled pork from this site. Nice pair. Thanks mommy.
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;englishell;5;Phenomenally delicious! The subtle flavor of avocado, along with the lemon juice/zest, and fresh cilantro and chia seeds gave a wonderful burst of flavor. Although I could not taste the cayenne per se, I think it probably helped the lemon from overpowering the taste
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;sweepingbeauty;5;Love this topped with fresh cut serrano chilis and toasted sesame seeds. Used sourdough toast.
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;sallyreeder;5;very good! Thank you.
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;jane;5;Easy, fast, & So good !
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;abbyshannon;5;Delicious! I loved the addition of the Chia seeds. I made two slices: on the second I added garlic salt instead of regular, and I liked that even more. The only difference I made to the first was to use a regular lemon. Sooo good!
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;patrickbabin;5;Hi quadrupled the recipe sprinkled sprinkled a little Chia seeds on top. Are used real lemon and lemon juice. Love it!
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;emmanuellerioux;5;Really easy. I put one whole avocado instead of the half for two toasts.
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;crabtreecatlady;4;While I love avocados and I loved this toast, half an avocado could not possibly have only 1g of fat. In my recipe importer at myfitnesspal, it list this recipe as 11g of fat.
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;jenniferalling;5;Delicious! Didn't have cilantro and it was still fantastic!!

fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;dennistobin;4;Heard about this a lot desided to try it to add to my skill set. Quick easy came out great for my brunch . Added an egg.
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;newbride;4;"We enjoyed this healthy recipe. Note that you need to zest the lemon; I didn't see that until after I had juiced it. We have a Meyer lemon tree so this will be a great way to use them - would also be fantastic with fresh lime juice. If you wanted something more decadent, a fried egg or bacon would make delicious additions. We doubled the avocado portion of the recipe and would do that again next time."
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;angeldoll;5;I was surprised how good this was! I had never tried Avocado Toast before so I looked up a recipe for it and this one sounded good. I didn’t have any cilantro so I substituted parsley (cilantro would have been better) Used fresh squeezed lemon juice and butter on the toast. This would be good on a bagel too, I will definitely make it again!
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;loriingraham;5;Delicious! I served with gazpacho and together they were the perfect summer meal.
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;laceydedecker;5;I didn’t have Chia seeds. But this was excellent. Easy, yummy, healthy, and my kiddo gave it a thumbs up as well.

fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;nipe;4;"I would make it again; I forgot the lemon zest"
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;truleighblessed;5;"Omg this was AMAZING. I literally just finished eating it and did not want to tarry in writing my review. This was my first time trying avocado toast and I must say I’m glad I chose this recipe to try! The flavors were a wowzer in my mouth; I followed the recipe exactly. On one of the slices I put a fried egg on top......yummy yummy yummy! It’s excellent both ways. Use a nice sized avocado so it will be enough for both slices. 5 stars!!"
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;julesm;5;Loved it as is!! Only changes I’ve made are sometimes adding extra of some things.. Was my go to lunch for work! Thanks!!
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;karenfox;5;Made this in the spur of the moment for a light Sunday night supper. I didn’t have the cilantro, but even so, it was fantastic. The lemon zest and juice made it taste extra fresh and bright.
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;tricia;5;The avocado spread was perfect, but next time I will double the recipe for two pieces of toast. I also added an over-easy egg, crumbled Nueske's bacon and finely chopped red onion on top of the avocado spread.
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;jnm;4;Good and gives it a nice twist. I didn’t expect to like the chia seeds on it, but it just gives it the slightest pop.
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;beckycarroll;5;Followed the recipe exactly except quadrupled the quantity for my group. Everyone loved it! It has a nice texture and delicious flavor. It was super easy as well. I did not have chia seeds but as the contributor suggested, went with sesame seeds to top. I served with bacon and cheese and some guests made a hearty sandwich. Thank you for the yummy recipe.
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;azure;4;Toast the seeds in a dry pan over medium heat for about 3 min to release the aromatic oils and get rid of any humidity. Don't burn them. Use saute (jumping) technique if possible.
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;barbloves2cook;5;Delicious! Since discovering this recipe I've tried all kinds of variations. They all worked well. I especially like it with green onions. I actually go to bed thinking about having a delicious breakfast in the morning.

fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;roseladd;5;Very Tasty & Toasty with the avocoda and lemon juice with a pinch of sea salt and cayenne! Combined on Vegan Ezekiel toast.
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;robh;5;This was delicious. The zest adds a lot of flavor. I used a whole avocado (1/2 avocado per slice of toast) and topped each one with a fried egg for a very satisfying breakfast.
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;judylzimmermanhertel;5;I am in love with Avocado toast !!!!!!!!
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;kscheer;5;Wonderful! It tastes like sunshine on toast. Definitely a keeper!
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;klea;5;This ESHA rating is off. An avocado is 21 g of fat per cup, bread is 72 cal per slice.
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;karen;5;so easy and fresh tasting! Only wish Meyer lemons were available for a longer period.
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;concretetaco;4;Very nice mix of flavors. We did not have chia seeds. Used ground pumpkin seeds. Our fresh lemon overpowered the other flavors, so we will try again with less lemon and more of the other ingredients. Definite plus to our breakfast options. Weill make it again
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;jack;4;Easy to make. I thought it was good but not great. That said, I'll have it again.
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;mel;5;This avocado spread is so delicious! I used pumpernickel bread and put pico de gallo in the spread. Excellent!!!

fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;linda;5;So easy and so good! I don’t care for spicy so I left out the cayanne pepper, but added chopped tomato’s.
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;patrickmundy;5;I've made this three times and love it. I find it to be a quick, easy breakfast that offers a new dimension to the old toast and jam morning fare. My wife and visiting company loved it.
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;amandatulumalo;5;So yummy!
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;kaitlynmoore;5;Wow! I used more avocado than it called for, but WOW.
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;coachjen;5;I love how lemony this recipe is. The zest and cayenne were nice and even though you don’t really taste the chia seeds they made a nice garnish.
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;islandgirl;5;I tweaked this recipe a bit, and the result was AMAZING! Instead of lemon zest, I used a little True Lemon (crystallized lemon), and WOW!!! I added a couple of slices of hard boiled egg, a light sprinkling of sea salt.....mmmmmm!!!
fdf68ad9-5326-4428-9008-463a82aa741f;buckwheatqueen;5;This is truly delicious. I've always used lime on avocado toast. What a head slapper of a recipe. Thank you for sharing.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;smacarages;4;Let me first say that I wish there was a way to give this recipe 4 and a half stars. I dont feel like 4 is indicative of how good this recipe actually is. It's soft with a great outer crunch. We munched on the end pieces without any white chocolate, it doesn't need, but its definitely a pretty touch. I would like the spice to be kicked up a notch and possibly the molasses, but it's truly delicious. Also, to everyone SO confused about oils instead of butter, more often than not biscotti uses oil. My favorite recipe for biscotti actually calls for olive oil, if I'm not mistaken, this is originally how they were made. Well done!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;amyh;3;Wow! Was the dough Sticky! A little help on how to actually get it out of bowl off your hands and onto the cookie sheet without feeling like you've walked into a giant spider web would've nice! But flavor was outstanding.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;nicolemartin;5;Excellent recipe! Turned out delicious & was very easy! Thanks
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;laurie;5;Great recipe. Easy to make
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;brookebates;5;These have become a perennial favorite with my family. I add white chocolate chips to them for some texture. When I first got together with my husband I sent these and a few other biscotti to him. When they got there he told me he wouldn’t like these particular ones because he doesn’t like gingerbread and he doesn’t like white chocolate. Long story short, these are his absolute favorite and he asks for them throughout the year and they are required for Christmas every year.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;javajoe2000;5;I substituted 5 1/3 TBLS of butter for the 1/3 cup oil and used organic minced ginger rather than dried.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;stephanielee;5;This is a lovely recipe for Christmas biscotti! The spices are spot on, no alterations required! Simple, easy to follow directions..i will definitely be making these again, and the house smells like Christmas!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;kimelle;5;Followed the recipe with one substitution. I used all purpose flour only. Added extra spices and baked for only 5 min each side to complete after the initial baking period . I’ve had rave reviews and will make again. My close friend has even asked for the recipe!!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;margierobinson;4;Very good recipe.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;vanessaconvard;5;These are fantastic! I used a blend of oil and butter. That seemed to work best for me. I feel like the oil vs butter choice is more personal than anything. These were super delicious and a wonderful way to begin every morning of my staycation.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;kimmerspinto;5;They were a hit at the office!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;lservia;5;These were amazing! So easy and delicious! Everyone loved them! I am making my second batch as I type! Yum! Can't wait to give away as Christmas gifts!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;valentine21462;5;I made these for my dad who loves gingerbread with lemon sauce. I put some lemon juice in the icing and he loved them!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;lisalave;5;Made it almost as written, didn't have any whole wheat flour. Fabulous, and my house couldn't smell any better! Should've doubled the batch!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;kevincroucher;1;I have made 100's of recipes of cookies/cakes/desserts. This has to be one of the worst recipes I have ever come across. Dough was beyond sticky. Way, way too much ginger and this recipe does NOT make two cookie 'loaves'. Add 1/2c more flour if you want to make this easier. or, just don't make it.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;carolg;4;Excellent recipe and final product.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;pattigutoskystrizak;5;Made these this morning and they came great!!! I used all white flour and they were perfect. I think next time I may drizzle some icing on them but the flavor profile was great!! Wil definitely make the again!! Super easy!!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;giga49;5;This is a great option for gingerbread lovers! wow! it definitely has the snap!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;janet;5;Yum, yum, these are soooooo good! Made per the recipe except took the suggestion of a reviewer who said she added 1/4 t baking soda and about that much salt. Oh, and I added about 1/4 t cayenne pepper! I noticed that several reviewers dipped or drizzled white chocolate, but since I didn't have any, I made a glaze of powdered sugar and the last of my maple syrup, with a dash of salt. The finished biscotti looked so elegant! And really, it was an easy recipe. Thanks for posting it!!!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;theequestrianbaker;5;Definitely worth rating it five Stars. It's really good for Christmas time, or little gifts for kids
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;donnaatkinson;5;These biscotti taste very close to gingerbread. The recipe is quite easy and my friends who tried them liked them a lot.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;catiebowler;5;I have made these every Christmas year after year after year. They are always requested! I always follow the recipe exactly and am very happy with the results.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;fruttidimare;5;Great biscotti, but I knew before making that it could do with a bit of a kick, so I did add a half cup of chopped crystallized ginger, a couple of TBSPs chopped fresh ginger, and about an 1/8 tsp pepper. Doesn't need any kind of icing/drizzle - great as is!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;duxallinarow;3;READ THE COMMENTS BEFORE YOU MAKE THIS. I've been making biscotti (from my own recipe) for years. I decided to step out of my comfort zone and try someone elses recipe, and gingerbread biscotti sounded like fun. Here's my take on the recipe. INGREDIENTS 1) Use whatever flour you have available, it doesn't impact the taste all that much. I used 2 3/4c unbleached white and 1c oat flour. 2) Oil vs butter is a matter of taste. But if you're using a salted butter, drop the added salt a bit to compensate. 3) The dough should properly be described as sticky, not stiff. You'll need up to 1/2c more flour to get it to hold together, and more for your hands to pat it into shape. 4) Needs 1/2-1t salt. Without salt, the flavors don't pop and there's no contrast. 5) I cook with sorghum rather than with molasses. 1:1, just changes the taste a little. 6) It may sound like a lot of spice, but the amounts listed don't overwhelm the cookie. Don't worry about exactness, and don't bother calculating what 1 1/2 T is. Just eyeball it. You'll never taste the difference. 7) I added 1t of ground black pepper (Tellicherry, FWIW). Black pepper is underused in baking IMHO. TEMP & TIMING 8) The temperature listed is way too hot. Preheat your oven to 325°, bake the loaves for the same 25 minutes, then let cool. 9) Slice the loaves, put the slices back into the oven for 10 minutes per side at the same 325°. Stand them up on the baking pans to cool and dry. Would I make this recipe again? No. The tast
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;vinceackerman;5;very easy to make, I want to also mess with the time and maybe a shorter time to make these the very slightest chewy in the center! But a success overall! (also, I doubled the spice ingredients, I think they are too bland if using the recipe recommended)
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;miriamloushearstharnish;3;"I have to wonder if the spice measurements were correct, as some of them were listed in tablespoons. Half a tablespoon or 3/4 tablespoon seems awkward. Did they mean teaspoons? Anyway, I made these with a gluten free flour blend, sub cup for cup, but added an extra 1/4 teaspoon of xanthan gum to help cohesion. I subbed gluten free oats for the whole wheat flour. Dough was extremely sticky, even after adding extra flour. I cut the slices thicker, about 3/4"", to avoid crumbling. On the second baking, I had to do at least ten minutes per side. Flavor was good, but very heavy on cloves. Half a tablespoon of cloves is too much. I made a simple glaze of lemon juice and confectioners sugar to finish them."
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;missysissyntx;5;First time I’ve ever made biscotti, this is an uncomplicated and delicious recipe. Though I did use coconut oil in place of vegetable oil. They came out beautifully and taste better than store bought!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;gabby;5;"Made as written using fresh grated nutmeg. Left off the drizzle/glaze partly because I like a plain biscotti and partly because I'm lazy. Give them out at a work cookie exchange where they received rave reviews; one woman ate all at her desk before going home :)"
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;dgrandma;5;This recipe definitely made it to my make-every-Christmas baking list! Loved the flavor and how easy it is to make. I used the lemon icing recipe by Carol to ice the biscotti and then after the icing had set, I used bittersweet chocolate melted and drizzled over the biscotti to make a very professional looking cookie. Gave them as gifts this year to rave reviews.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;buckeyblonde;5;This is a Christmas keeper!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;breezemozelcogecoca;3;"Well, I would use 1/2 cup of butter instead of vegetable oil and much more spice, I like the idea of adding black pepper. This biscotti turned out extremely hard, dried out and over cooked! The cooking time should be 20-25 min on 350* ""not 40 min""! I looked at several other biscotti recipes and lower temp and shorter times are recommended."
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;katebaxter;5;These were great. It is my second try at biscotti. The first one was pistachio and cranberries and it seem very labourious. But that was because I hadn't made them before. This time with the experience behind me it was so much easier and I wasn't so nervous about doing the wrong thing. I chose to follow Baricat's advice (Thanks Baricat!) for ingredients and baking. I agree no butter just oil. When they finally came out of the oven they looked like an ad for biscotti! I am so proud of myself and they are delicious!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;tracieinnorthcarolina;4;I melted some white chocolate and slathered one side of each piece. Delish! This one has gone into my favorites file. Very easy to make, but prepare for crumbs!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;maryjohnjeff;4;I made them per the recipe and they came out great.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;halligirl;3;Only suggestion I can make is to read the other suggestions. Quite bland as the gingerbread taste goes, will use the recipe again adding an extra teaspoon of ground clove and perhaps allspice. This was my first go round for this recipe.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;cher;5;These are perfect, lots of spice, I even add a bit of black pepper. The dough is sticky, it's supposed to be, don't over handle.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;kittieblues;3;My opinion? It's a decent gingersnap recipe. It's tasty and zesty
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;ppk;3;As is maybe a 3 star. We will keep this but use regular flour instead of whole wheat. Also we did use 1/2 tsp cloves per reviews since we didn't want a real strong clove flavor. When buying the molasses they only had one kind & it wasn't what I usually use. This bottle wasn't as strong of a molasses flavor as we like. Once I can use up this bottle on something I'll get my regular molasses for the next time we make.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;onthefly;4;"I made this recipe using Firefly08's tips on using butter instead of oil and cutting it into the dry ingredients and the biscotti turned out perfectly! We love this recipe and will now make it a holiday mainstay. Perfect to give as gifts to good neighbors ;)"
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;kellywilliams;5;This recipe is wonderful! I, too, used butter instead of oil, and followed another reviewer's suggestion to add black pepper to the mixture ~ The results were outstanding! The biscotti is not too sweet, and has a bold, flavorful kick. The best tip I've heard so far & can attest to is to not over-mix the dough. Opt to mix by hand instead of using a mixer :)
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;missrochester;5;These turned out EXCELLENT! VERY flavorful! the texture was spot on! No need to change a thing! Perfect as is!!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;alk5b;3;I had a really hard time deciding between 3 or 4 stars. I made these exactly as stated, my biggest complaint is that the taste was good but too subtle. Maybe my spices are too old?
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;chefv;5;Wonderful! This was my first attempt ever at making biscotti.. I've always been intimated by it, and I'm not sure why. I didn't change a thing although I thought the measurements were too much at first. After tasting they are great.. If you like Gingerbread you will like these! If the clone is too much for some people just cut back and add more ginger. I wouldn't change a thing though! This was just a trial run, and I want to make some for Christmas gifts this year. Will definitely dip and drizzle with white chocolate and maybe some festive sprinkles. Thanks for this recipe :)
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;donnagwpgman;5;in a word.. YUM !! used all white flour - as I can't 'do' whole wheat.. drizzled very lemony icing over top then sprinkled icing sugar over that.. I make biscotti quite often -- this recipe will be right up there with my all time favorites.. thanks Cristina..
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;marion;5;This recipe is great! My dough had nowhere near enough moisture (thanks high altitude Alberta) so I added about 2/3 cup water gradually until I could work the dough. I also followed the recommendation to mix the dry ingredients together, cut in the butter and then add the eggs and molasses. They were a hit!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;aurorajackson;5;I've made these every year for the past 4 years, and they are requested by friends and family regularly for Christmas gifts. I decrease the cloves to 1/2 teaspoon instead of tablespoon, and add some fresh ginger. Easy and delicious!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;samsombody;2;Bland. And that's after adding salt that wasn't even in the ingredient list. My daughter already said that she likes them so at least they won't go to waste.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;josephineroeper;5;This was surprisingly good. I did not have almond bark so I drizzled some AR's Gingerbread Frosting for Cookies. The dried frosting is more of an icing texture. It enhanced the biscotti perfectly. The biscotti was perfect as far as texture and flavor. I made the original recipe as is and was able to make about 2 dozen. Not sure how 4 dozen is possible unless you double the original servings. Either way, I will make again eapecially in December.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;chelles1;5;We love this biscotti. I've made it both with oil and butter and turned out great both times. They are a fun easy treat to make.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;bbh;2;No pop of taste in this biscotti. I thought these were very bland. I will not be making these again.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;chiquitabanana;5;very good, especially with the white chocolate! i melt it and pipe it on with the plastic bag. perfect for Christmas.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;robmc;1;Not good. Is the 1/2 tablespoon ground cloves a typo??? I have never put that amount in any recipe and it totally ruined the flavor of this biscotti.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;mamamia28;1;Made as directed, the oven temp is too high or the cookie has to cook too long resulting in scorched ginger leading to a bitter cookie that did not completely dry out as biscotti should. If you make these maybe decrease oven temp to 325 or 350? Won't make again.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;cblwolf;5;Yum, yum, YUM!! I followed the recipe exactly as written in regards to ingredients and mixing method. I only made one large log, though. I ended up baking the cut biscotti for about 9 minutes per side to get them perfectly crunchy! These are great without the white chocolate, but spectacular with it! Thanks for sharing!!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;misshellis;4;These should be called clove-ginger biscotti. If you are not crazy about cloves, cut back on it. It is pretty potent. Love these with coffee, however.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;raschelk;5;I also used 1/3 cup of salted butter instead of oil, and I cut it into the dry ingredients, minus the sugar, then mixed the sugar with the wet ingredients and added the wet and dry together. I was a bit skeptical of how crumbly the dough seemed, but just as many other reviewers have said, it firmed up significantly on baking. One thing I did to help with forming the loaves since it was so crumbly was put a sheet of parchment paper on the cookie sheet, then dumped half the mixture on and formed it into a loaf, then did the same with the other half and baked them on the parchment paper on the cookie sheet. I don't think I could have made loaves and then moved them onto the sheet, but doing it this way worked really well. I also baked them the first time for 30 minutes, which seemed to be just right, as they seemed too soft at 25 minutes. I made a confectioner's sugar glaze to drizzle, and am loving them!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;trish;5;Great biscottis!! Normally ale almond but tried this for Christmas. Instead of oil I softened about 6 tablespoons butter. I normally use butter in ally recipes and used white flour. Drizzled powder sugar icing. Awesome.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;joyceofcooking;4;Like other reviewers, I added 1/4 t. each salt and pepper, and 1/2 t. baking soda. I upped the spices, added cardamom (just because I like it) used all AP flour and went 1/2 and 1/2 brown sugar and white sugar. Then I folded in 1/3 c. finely chopped candied ginger. Handled the dough as little as possible, dividing it in half early in the mixing and adding 1/3 c. raisins to one half, because DH is a raisin freak. Raisins work, but are not needed, and they make slicing more challenging. Result is pretty, sliced well, and has a decent level of spiciness. Still, mine is not as crispy as other reviewers thought, and I need to up the spices still more - mostly black pepper, I think, and some fresh grated ginger, too. Dough was dry enough to handle that much extra moisture.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;roby;5;I followed what another viewer mentioned about cutting in butter vs using oil. Especially since I don't know anything about making biscotti. This is really nice biscotti. I'm surprised with all the spices in it that its not more spicey. Maybe tomorrow after sitting overnight it will be.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;jmlarsen95;3;This recipe was good but I think it could be better. I agree with many other reviews that it needed a little more flavor. Next time I make these I will increase the spices two fold and add an icing to it.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;kcbee;4;Really, really good!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;ardys;5;I LOVE these biscotti!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;sandir;5;Absolutely delicious! Wow! Melted vanilla almond bark & dipped bottoms of biscotti's, then when cool, layed them on their side and drizzled one side as well. Absolutely gorgeous and they were gobbled up by the family. Also gifted a tin of them for Xmas & they were thoroughly loved.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;canadacookin;5;Delicious! Thanks for a little something different that I could take in to the pre-Christmas 'treats week' lunch room bonanza.It was nice to share such a yummy coffee treat. I followed the recipe and was very pleased.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;robinmonks;2;Not a great flavor.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;hotinmykitchen;4;These were pretty good. I think they needed a little more of a spicey taste, I might increase the ginger next time and add some salt. Otherwise very good. Do not use butter, a friend of mine who makes great Italian biscotti says you always use oil for a genuine biscotti. I drizzled they with a lemon glaze made from powdered sugar and fresh lemon juice and that really added a nice touch.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;vesna;5;Baked the biscotti yesterday, they turned out good, no fuss with preparation. Although I tweaked a bit, omitted molasses (molasses are not available in my country, and I had no honey). I used oil, and my experience with some excellent biscotti recipes from this site is good oil-wise. I like unblanched almonds and thus added 1 cup of those. Used brown sugar for ginger-bread appearance. Summarized, excellent recipe, works, tastes good... just do it
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;katquilter;5;These are fantastic! I halved the amount of ginger because I didn't want them too strong for the non ginger eating daughter. Just delicious and so pretty drizzled with white chocolate! Good enough for a cookie exchange this weekend :)
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;cathiemcfadden;3;The taste was good, but the temp of 375 is way to high. It burned my first batch on the bottom. and I only left them in 17 minutes. Will remake the recipe again at 350 for 15 minutes like all the biscotti I make.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;denise;5;Love this recipe! Very easy. I made exactly as written and they turned out great. I used blackstrap molasses because that's what I had on hand and I don't know if that made any difference, but they tasted great! Will definatley be making these again!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;spottucker;5;This was really good and I liked it a lot. Right now I'm just trying not to eat all of it before dinner.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;donnam;4;I loved this recipe!! I read a lot of the reviews and this is what I did....... I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of the regular whole wheat. I also threw in some finely chopped crystallized ginger. I did lower the temperature to 350 for the initial baking and for the second baking - I did not lay the cookies down - I kept them standing up, separated and baked at 300 for 20-25 minutes. I did not put the white chocolate on either - loved them exactly the way they were. I had no problems with the dough, maybe the pastry flour helped, not sure, but I cannot wait to make thee again!!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;mrsfisher0729;5;These went over really well at a fall-themed dessert night. I dipped mine in white chocolate chips.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;lpnlab;5;Absolutely delicious! I make biscotti for the holidays and this will definitely be added to my collection. The only thing I did different was use all white flour because I didn't have wheat and I added white chocolate chips.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;liz;4;This recipe turned out well and I definitely would make it again. I feel like it could use a little something-something to make the flavors really come out, but I can't put my finger on what exactly it needs. I had no problems with the biscotti coming out too tough and I followed the recipe exactly. After they cooled I drizzled some gingerbread frosting (recipe found on this site) over top and it did help a bit with jazzing it up. I would even consider adding some dried fruit to this recipe.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;kimtymecki;5;Turned out great! Followed recipe exactly, except I added a tsp of allspice, cause my grandma taught me that when you add nutmeg you add allspice, also, I just used all purpose flour... The dough was far too sticky to do anything with, so I added flour until I could work with it. Turned out great! Even the baking times were spot on for me.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;marianne;5;Great! I added chopped crystalized ginger, along with 1/4 tsp of baking soda per someone elses review, and it came out fantastic!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;largesse;5;Delicious! I did reduce the spices considerably, because I wanted a milder cookie (1/2 t each of cinnamon and ginger), but otherwise I followed the recipe. I shared these at work and got rave reviews! Thanks so much!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;tanya;5;Will definately make each Christmas.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;else;5;Thanks Christina - This is a great treat. Added a handful of raisins but made no other changes.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;tanyaburrows;5;Delicious! This is such a great tasting biscotti with such wonderful flavor. It pairs so well with coffee. Definitely a keeper!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;janearena;5;Wonderful recipe.... I made it twice this holiday season - the first time I did not have any wheat flour so just substituted all purpose. I also added chocolate and white chocolate drizzle on top. This second round, I used the original ingredients although used a little more molasses than called for. They're in the oven now and looking really promising!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;fitforaqueenclothingcom;5;Followed the recipe exactly as written and came out fabulous! I formed my roll right on the cookie sheet instead of forming on the counter and then transferring it. so easy!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;jennifer;4;Great recipe as written. Modifications: added chopped dried fruit (apples, pears, apricots, red plums and black plums). They cook better for the second baking if placed on a non-stick pizza pan rather than the original cookie sheet. The cookie sheet batch had to cook longer and I ended up standing them upright. Glaze:icing sugar, a bit of butter, milk, and citrus zest. Delicious for a first attempt at biscotti.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;renea;3;Good, but not the best biscotti I have made. The dough was VERY sticky. I baked mine at 350 for 35 minutes and only made it into one long log and it was perfect in texture and color. My husband and I found them to be somewhat of a bitter after taste. Next time I would switch out the oil for butter (prefer it in my biscotti) and add a bit of cream of tarter for the slight bitterness and definitely another 1/4 cup sugar. True Italian Biscotti never uses butter only oil, but we prefer it done with butter. Happy cooking to all!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;tanyapetkosschroeder;5;Loved this recipe! I was a little hesitant about using the oil, based on other reviews, but they turned out great! I only baked for 4 minutes per side for my second baking. The dough is very crumbly when you first lay it out on your baking sheet, but it does bake up nicely. I drizzled mine with white chocolate to which I added a few drops of lemon extract. Nice combo!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;jnez625;4;"I enjoyed this recipe. As others have mentioned, they're not super-spiced, but I think that makes more sense for biscotti, as they don't tend to be super-sweet cookies. Dipped in milk or coffee, they taste like Christmas. However, mine didn't turn out crispy; they're more dense and a bit chewey. I have another biscotte recipe that calls for doing an initial bake at a lower tempt for longer, and I may try that next time to see if I get a more biscotti-like texture. And a warning: These really spread out during baking. It's not a negative of the recipe, but I wish I had known that in advance because I would have made my logs narrower."
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;evawodlinger;4;They were delicious, but be careful as they burn quickly (watch them on the second baking)
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;pattyann;5;This recipe is a keeper as-is. Made a batch this morning following directions as printed. They came out great but missed a bit of a kick only because I had one tablespoon of ginger left in the jar. I'm making another batch this afternoon (bought some ginger) and plan to spice it up with more ginger, some crystallized ginger and black pepper.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;christal88;4;I have to admit I made a few changes the first time I made these. (I usually try a recipe as is the first time). I used brown sugar instead of white, and only AP flour. They are fantastic, I love the flavor, but they needed to be a little crispier, so next batch I make I am going to decrease the temp and cook them a bit longer.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;ksh;5;I made these for Christmas this year. Very Good with a cup of coffee or tea. Makes a nice treat to take to a party or coffee klatch. Will make again.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;katy;5;Made as written except I added crystalized ginger cut up in tiny bits and a few turns of fresh ground pepper and I used Siagon Cinnamon. Really ramped up the spice level! This was my test run, will make again for upcoming guests and as gifts. I'd like to try it with butter sometime just to see the difference. This is as good or better than the Starbucks cookie. My husband who usually doesn't say much with my cooking experiments said this is a keeper.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;lisadieterle;4;I had few changes. I had to use all white flour due to an allergy to whole wheat and not sure if the sub is actually 1:1 but that's what I did. I didn't follow directions and made into one log due to the fact that I wanted long biscotti. My own error was not baking longer because part of it was undercooked. Not so bad when you have to bake two more times but it made it harder to cut without chunks coming out and still maintain a nice looking cookie but that was my error. The reason for the 4 stars is because it needs more spices. It was a pretty bland gingerbread and needed more of a kick. Would make again with more spices.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;princessfaith82;5;This was the first time EVER making biscotti and it turned out perfectly thanks to the recipe and a few suggestions from other reviewers! I mixed the dry ingredients and the wet ingredients sperately then added the wet to the dry to form the dough. Once I had the dough sperated and each rolled out I brushed lightly with vegetable oil and sprinkled with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar in the raw onboth sides. I baked each according to directions, the let them cool--just to the touch-and sliced them with a pizza cutter! (The pizza cutter works great for this!). I then baked them for 7 minutes on each side to make them have the crunchy texture I love. They turned out do beautifully they looked professional! Next time I may go to the extra effort and dip then either dark or white chocolate. Should be delish!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;delight;5;I have a new favorite holiday cookie! Firefly08's additional instructions were helpful, and I did dip in white chocolate as suggested by many. Delightful changeup from the traditional gingerbread cookie!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;cperr;5;Very tastey!! This will be a new holiday recipe I will add to my collection!!!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;sharoncollins;5;very good.. I think the reason for using oil rather than butter is for food safe reasons. Biscotti is meant is to be long lasting & none refridgerated. Just a guess...not sure..but that makes sense to me. Very tasty indeed..didn't change the recipe at all..they are sticky to shape due to the molasses. I just dusted my hands with flour to make it easier.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;jasgirl;1;I did not care for this recipe.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;karabou;5;These turned out great! I followed the recipe exactly and loved the texture and flavor. Based on other reviews I debated using butter instead of oil, but in the end opted to go with the oil. I am glad I did. The crunch was perfect and the cookie didn't crumble away when dipped in coffee. The only thing I would do different next time is make one loaf instead of two. They came out like mini biscotti, I like them a bit bigger (I would have to play with cooking time though).
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;yaycookies;5;"Made these last year for xmas and I will definately make these again this year. Was nervous that it was my first time trying a biscotti recipe but followed the directions closely and they came out perfect! Dipped them in white chocolate and added crushed peppermint sticks, the presentation alone was divine. Very fun to play around with different designs with the chocolate. Added these to my bag of treats to hand out to loved ones along with ""Oatmeal Chip"" cookie recipe on this site by Nancy Fridirici, made them with holiday green and red m&ms, so good! THanks for the wonderful recipe!"
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;sprawlins;5;I am not a fan of molasses or gingerbread, but after two years of a friend raving about these, I made them... and now I'm hooked! They are amazing! Definitely follow the changes Firefly 08 suggests. Okay, I'm going to go and eat some more :)
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;mom;5;After reading some reviews I used butter instead of vegetable oil and these came out PERFECT! They weren't too hard or too soft and had the right texture. These were delicious and had the perfect amount of spice for my taste. Though I had no white chocolate on me I'm sure it would be a great drizzle for it.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;amylyn;5;My daughter used this recipe for county fair and got a purple, she qualified for the state fair and got a purple at the state fair! She followed the recipe exactly. She baked it on a pampered chef baking stone and drizzled it with melted white chocolate. Wonderful recipe Cristina, thanks for sharing it!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;krysteen;5;awesome flavor! i added a dash of black pepper to mine and dipped the in a simple powdered sugar glaze. next time i will decrease the initial cook time though from 25 minutes to 20 minutes as the edges started to burn.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;rachelt;2;baked this for a friend, but the biscotti burned at the edges and i had to cut them off. added 1/4 tsp ground pepper, 1/4 tsp more nutmeg and 1/2 tsp salt, and it still was pretty bland. was not impressed, waste of my ingredients and time.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;princesa97;2;I didn't really care or these. Need more of something, but not quite sure what.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;me4;5;5 stars with these changes: Use bread flour (not wheat or all purpose), add (in addition to oil) 1 softened stick of butter, add 2 level teaspoons of pepper, a little more cinnamon, (and don't be afraid of a little more of the other spices depending on what you favor). The temperature was fine. 28 - 30 minutes initial cook, let cool completely, cut and recook 8 minutes, cool completely and even leave out to harden some more- then store. *The pepper is needed to give it that spice you need.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;nachomama;1;My family and I didnt care for this. Spices were a little off and was more hard than crispy.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;colleenmarie;5;This is by far my favorite Biscotti recipe!!! Everything about it is perfect and it reminds me of Christmas cookies.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;chefsteph;5;A lot easier than I expected, yet still fancy! Will be making again!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;dorkzoe;3;a little spice or flavor needed.... I dipped mine in chocolate - which made it good. Will try another biscotti recipe.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;sherristeiner;4;Friends loved it. I drizzled with white chocolate. Dec. 2010
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;suzyn;5;"Very good. Used all white flour and when cooled dipped them in melted ""white chocolate"". Big hit!"
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;javaloving;4;Great recipe! It was even better when dipped in melted white chocolate. Would give it 5 stars if the recipe suggested to dip it in white chocolate. Besides that wouldn't change anything about the recipe. Very good!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;catherine;4;This is a nice textured biscotti. I have made a lot of biscotti and this dough was definitely not stiff. Indeed it was wetter than most biscotti dough. I formed it into one log, making longer biscotti. You could form it into two logs and get smaller biscotti. I think the time in the recipe is set for one loaf. I had no problem with baking time. This has mild gingerbread flavor. I prefer more spice! I added 2 Tablespoons chopped candied ginger, used brown sugar instead of white and rounded the teaspoons on the spices - but for my taste, it was still quite mild.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;tasha;5;These turned out perfect - Great recipe!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;summerlynn;3;I thought this recipe was good, but not all that flavorful. Maybe it was missing vanilla or something. I did follow all directions exactly, but I've had better and made better. Sometimes things like this taste better after a day or two so if I like it better I will come back and change the rating. It was easy to make though, which was nice.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;canuckfromthenorth;5;Sorry but these burnt in my oven after 20 mins on the bottoms & my oven doesnt run too hot. What a disappointment. I had to scrape the black bottoms off the logs to salvage them. Wouldnt make again. Big disappointment
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;motherann;5;Excellent! I took the advice of some other reviewers and used butter instead of oil. I was going to drizzle white chocolate over it, but I scorched the chocolate while melting it, so I just made a vanilla glaze and drizzled that instead. They are so tasty! These are going to go so well with coffee, tea, or hot chocolate. I've never made biscotti before so I am pleased how well this came out for me. Thank you for this easy recipe!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;tlc;5;Wonderful recipe as written and does not need any modifications. I did bake them a little bit longer on the second bake, as I wanted them a little bit more firmer then they were. I also dipped some of them in a little white chocolate. It helps to dampen your hands in cool water when shaping the logs on the cookie sheet, that way they are not as sticky.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;heatherh;4;I followed the modified recipe from Firefly08 and it turned out great! I added just a few drops of water to the dough as I worked it, which helped with the dryness. I added the lemon white chocolate drizzle as well, but the most significant change I made, which made these truly irresistible was I sprinkled a mix of sugar-in-the-raw and coarse sea salt on top of the dough before baking. Scrumptious!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;bstep;4;Very nice recipe. The spice is nice and light. If you're looking for a nice change of pace, this is definitely up there. I dipped part of ours with white chocolate, and next time, maybe I would add chopped walnuts. But turned out lovely. I would make it again.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;vickylm;5;These are delicious and for my first attempt at making biscotti even I was amazed at myself!! Dipping these into coffee is just heavenly!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;divadana;5;I made this last year and it was a HUGE hit. I added just a little lemon flavoring to the almond bark and it made a huge difference. Not to mention, I probably spent only $20 to gift to 40 people!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;jennifer;5;"Very nice! Followed the recipe to the T; just didn't dip in chocolate.. I'm not a ginger fan; but the crispiness was there; and stayed crispy even in a plastic container"
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;bree;5;Delish! Went down a treat :) I dipped them in white choc but next time will drizzle the chocolate on. Yum will be making these again. I followed FireFly08's suggestions and alterations and they came out great, think next time I will add vanilla and bake them longer on the second bake to get them crunchier.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;erinolander;5;Oh my gosh, YUM! I added a little pepper to give the gingerbread a bit of a kick, but other than that I followed the recipe. Very easy, good results. I'm going to make a whole slew of these biscotti for our Christmas party!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;nicole;5;Great recipe as written. I actually didn't have any cloves and it still turned out great! A bit of trial and error as far as how long to toast the pieces, but I would highly recommend it!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;foxyquilter;5;Perfect. I didn't change a single thing. They mixed together perfectly and taste delicious. Just have to frost them a little and am taking them for gifts tonight. Next time I might put them in my big Kitchen aid to mix, but I was really pleased with the mixture. Will definitely make again.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;victor;5;very easy to do.. great recipe
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;biokerristry;4;Very good! This was my first time making biscotti and these were enjoyed. I melted white chocolate and spread it over each cookie. Will definitely make again.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;pamelaarsethnault;5;This was my first try at making biscotti and I was very happy with the results. I think I over-kneaded them because my dough was rather crumbly and hard to form for me, but I will try another reviewers tip of oiling my hands before I make them again - and I will! It made the kitchen smell divine!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;leonabella;5;LOVED these. Followed the directions precisely as written and they came out perfectly! I made a orange frosting glaze to dip each of the finished biscotti in. You can't go wrong with orange and ginger. Perfect for coffee or a hot cup of earl gray tea.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;stellaobscura;5;Amazing. Even my picky eater loved these. Great flavor. We dipped ours in white chocolate, milk chocolate, and leftover icing from our gingerbread cookies. Will be baking more and giving them away as small Christmas gifts. Thank you.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;sara;5;"Delish! Next time I will leave out the nutmeg and cloves, as I've realized this season that I don't care for ""spicy"" in my gingerbread."
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;josielandon;5;Absolutely wonderful. I let the dough chill for about 30 minutes and oiled my hands before forming the log. Baked on parchment paper and they turned out great! I coated mine in white chocolate with red sprinkles as a Holiday treat for friends.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;shorecook;5;GREAT taste! I did use all purpose flour in place of the whole wheat flour as I didn't have any. The only other change I made was to lower the temperature to 325 degrees for the second baking. I put them in for 10 minutes on each side. The recipe was hard to follow because I had to make adjustments for the spices. They are written in fractions of a tablespoon and my measuring spoons are not that size. The ground ginger at 1 1/2 tablespoons would be 1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons...the cinnamon at 3/4 tablespoon would be 2 1/4 teaspoons....the ground cloves at 1/2 tablespoon would be 1 1/2 teaspoons..the nutmeg is fine! I hope this helps others so you don't have to figure it out. (and myself the next time I make it. lol) The biscotti is so good the recipe is still worthy of 5 stars! The aroma of this baking will knock your socks off! Thank you Cristina for sharing. It is being included in my assortment of biscotti Christmas gifts.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;shelovestocook;5;Great flavour. Added 1/2 cup toasted hazelnuts. Next time I will split dough into 3 logs to make smaller cookies - they really spread.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;snowcat;4;very easy to make. i followed the recipe without alterations. cookies came out delicious and beautiful.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;cheflefty;5;I made these as part of a care package- absolutely delicious. Next time I am going to make a double batch-they don't last very long :))
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;naomi;5;LOVE this recipe!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;melissathornton;5;mmm... Made these exactly like the recipe states with all the spices being heaping measurements since I do like a tasty biscotti. I appreciate recipes that call for oil since it is so much cheaper, and these were delicious regardless. And it sure is nice and crispy but not tough and crunchy. The dough wasn't hard to handle, but even easier when I added oil to my hands. I didn't have to cook them as long and maybe that is related to my elevation but it was only shorter by a minute or two. I have made these for a family Halloween dance and for a bake sale so I haven't dipped them yet in white chocolate like I plan to the day before. They are still amazing and can't wait to try them dipped.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;tim;4;I used 1 teaspoons of cloves rather than 1/2 Tablespoon, to avoid the strong clove taste that I don't enjoy. Otherwise, everything is perfect with this recipe and I had no problems with the dough as it had great texture. I think it is important to avoid overmixing the dough. I cooked the biscotti for the full seven minutes on each side for an incredible professional-like texture. These were a winner in my house and will be including in my upcoming Christmas gift baskets.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;tamie33;5;Loved these! I made this biscotti and it was so good! Made exactly as recipe stated and they turned out beautifully. Will certainly make again!!!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;cindyinpensacola;5;Oh my goodness, this was absolutely delicious! I've made a lot of biscotti and I think this is my new favorite. I did use egg beaters instead of eggs but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. As with all biscotti, you need to use wet hands to form the loaves on the parchment covered baking sheet. Smooth them out and shape into long rectangles. They probably should have baked for about 5 more minutes but I just upped the baking time after they were cut. I then spread a bit of white baking chocolate over the cut edge on one side. I had to make a pot of coffee just so I could try one of these little gems and I wasn't disappointed! Tastes like autumn in your mouth!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;wordsmythwmn;5;Very good flavor, dunkability, texture to this striking biscotti. I substituted oatmeal flour for the wheat flour. (just whiz quick oats in blender until powdered). Used 1/3 cup molasses, and 2 eggs. Also substituted 1/4 cup brown sugar, and used 3/4 cup granulated white sugar. Manifique' !!!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;tiffany;5;I make these every year and they're a HUGE hit. Dipping in white chocolate is a must. I've made it with various molasses, and I find Black Strap Molasses gives the best flavour. Love this recipe!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;inky86;5;Awesome! Easy recipe to follow, absolutely delish. I will be using these for X-Mas Gifts! Thanks again for the great recipe.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;kimsfood;5;This was excellent and paired with chai tea made a great Christmas gift!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;amymcmillan;5;I followed FireFly08's suggestions as I had never made biscotti before. Thank you FireFly08! Great suggestions! Mine turned out very well, although I made a few changes. I had a commercial pumpkin biscotti at my local coffee shop and wanted to make something similar without all the chemical preservatives. Instead of the molassas, I added canned, pureed pumpkin- just a smidge more than the 1/4 cup of molassas and I reduced the ginger a little bit. They were amazing!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;scarletbegonia;5;FABU!!! I, too, used 1/3 c of butter and used only egg whites. FYI you're looking at ONE WEIGHT WATCHERS POINT each made this way.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;narien;5;"I substituted molasses with honey; the first bake took 19 min, and for the second I put them on a rack, so they only need 5 min once. Glazed with powdered sugar mixed with fresh orange juice. They came out spectacular, next time though, I might add an extra half tablespoon of ginger."
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;cyddelve;4;"these came out pretty good---I am NOT a baker, and have never baked anything from scratch before; these don't have quite the familiar texture that I'm used to with biscotti, but that might be because I substituted stevia for the sugar and EggBeaters for the eggs. The flavor is lovely, and overall, I'm pleased with the outcome."
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;paul;5;This is a very good recipe as written, had no problem with it at all.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;marylouisewhitlow;4;Used all purpose flour (did not have any whole wheat). Very good and makes the house smell wonderful!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;bridy;5;So easy! My first time making Biscotti and this was easier then I thought. I made a chocolate glaze. 3/4 cup icing sugar, 1-2tbsp water, 1tsp vanilla, 1Tbsp butter and 1 oz semmi-sweet chocolate(melted), butternilk to thin out enough to drizzled on top. very good.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;recipesneedgluten;5;delicious-great alternative for DH's desire for ginger snaps. I have tried so many ginger snap recipes-defferent ways of storing them, etc. This tastes great and stays crunchy
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;cupcake;5;Delicious! Wonderful served with hot tea.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;rashal;5;Wowie! I loved this biscotti. I made as the recipe stated with oil. The explanation about Italians using oil instead of butter makes sense. I also poured oil on my hands before forming the logs to keep the dough from sticking to me. I drizzled the tops with a white chocolate glaze. This will definitely be in my Christmas keepers.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;deopam;3;I made this recipe but used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. I used only about 2 teaspoons of ginger and it was still pretty ginger tasting in the end. I recommend using less ginger. Also, the bake time of 25 minutes was too much- I recommend checking the oven around 20 minutes. And I will DEFINITELY not have the Biscotti dry out in 6 minutes. one batch ended up burned.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;sara;4;Yummy...but not quite spicy enough. I'll add pepper next time like other reviewers suggested. Once I dipped in white chocolate it was VERY yummy of course. It would look prettier with a drizzle of white and milk chocolate. NOTE: the oven may need to be turned down to 350. It burned on the bottom before it was done then when I baked the second time it was already too brown to leave in for very long. It didn't turn out as crispy as I would have liked.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;cotecote;4;I think I over cooked my biscotti. When I put it in the oven the second time I felt like it wasn't crunchy so I cooked it about another 20 minutes and it was really hard. It does get crunchy when it sits out of the oven. So I will try again another time! The taste of the spices was very tasty!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;corpman;4;THESE WERE GREAT DIPPED IN WHITE CHOCOLATE...
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;schasel;2;Maybe I didn't do something right as this was my first time with biscotti, but this did not come out well for me.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;wileyp;5;"I don't know what the difficulty is that some folks seem to have with this recipe. With the exception of normal adjustments I make due to my altitude (8,000 feet), I followed the recipe and these biscotti come out fantastic! My dough was not as ""sticky"" as it probably should have been, but then, I add 25% more flour. Still, the texture and crumb were perfect and they toasted up beautifully during the second bake. I added a sugar glaze (1 cup confectioners' sugar and 2 Tbsp. water) after they were done."
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;dianne;5;These are heavenly! I made them according to the recipe except I replaced the whole wheat flour with regular flour. Then drizzled with melted white chocolater chips. Perfect!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;jimk;5;A favorite and so good with coffee.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;punkgirl;5;I made three kinds of biscotti to give away as Christmas treats. These were by far the best ones.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;michelle2828;5;These were yummy! They go great with chai tea, milk, and coffee! Went over very well on Christmas!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;scarlett;5;I love gingerbread and I love biscotti crunch, so this is a match made in heaven!!! It was much easier to make than I feared (hey, biscotti sounds intimidating) and I love that the recipe already includes whole wheat flour. I used brown sugar instead of white+molasses, and added craisins for a festive bit of tangy chew. To make them extra gift-fancy, I smeared chocolate ganache on one side and drizzled w/ white chocolate. TOTAL KEEPER I will make this for stocking stuffers every year now! Thanks!!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;superpooper;5;"Let me first say, I always try a recipe as written first (get sick of people making up their own version and rating that). This was terrific. The whole family loved it. Ok, so I didn change one thing... instead of veg. oil, I used light olive oil. Ok, and for the oven temp. I set it at 360 (I was worried from other reviews about burning, and since I was making this as gifts, I wanted to make sure they I didn't screw it up). And I did lay my ""logs"" on parchment paper.... other than that, followed all the ingredients to a ""T"" and it came out perfect. I ended up making a second batch because they were so good I wanted some for myself. The consistency was perfect and easy to work with. The spices were spot on... make sure you're adding the correct amount. At first I thought it said 1 1/2 teaspoon, but it was tablespoon... maybe that's where other people went wrong when they said it didn't have the spices that they wanted. Anyway, I dipped in in white chocolate like in the photo and... it's a beautiful thing! Very good. Make them... and follow the recipe... it's good!"
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;emmanz;4;Thanks Firefly08, I tried this last night making the changes you suggested and they turned out really well! Will be great with coffee on Christmas evening.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;cinadiane;2;I'm not sure what happened - maybe I left it in for too long, but my logs turned into a crumbled mess. No biscotti for me :( I put what I could salvage in a pie dish and melted chocolate chips on it. I'm planning on serving it with ice cream.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;hollie;2;The consistency would have been perfect but, even being generous with the spices and adding black pepper, they were 100% bland and therefore, with the texture, tasted like dog biscuits. No one in my house would touch them after one bite.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;lotusstar;5;love it! i'm gonna be making more in the future for sure. thanks for the recipe!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;kate;5;Wonderful for the holidays! I doubled the spices and added 1/4 tsp black pepper and 1/8 tsp salt. Baked at 350 instead of 375 like someone suggested. Drizzled with white chocolate. They were the perfect spicy companion for coffee after Christmas shopping.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;grandmawen;5;Five star recipe! I did make some adjustments, however - I used only white flour, no whole wheat. I added a tsp. of baking soda and 1/2 tsp. salt, used 2 heaping tablespoons of ginger, and 1 1/2 tbsp cinnamon in addition to the usual cloves and nutmeg. I also added some finally minced candied ginger - probably about 1/2 cup (I bought this at Trader Joe's). After slicing and cooling the biscotti, I put them in the freezer for 10 minutes while I melted vanilla candy coating, then dipped the top side of each in that and placed on waxed paper to harden. They are SO delicious. Perfect for a holiday gift exchange.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;ilovetoeat;4;I made this exactly as the recipe intructs. It was very sticky. I think these are delicious and I like the texture. I am going to make myself another batch and try the black pepper recommendation.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;kristen;4;Great alternative to the extra sweet holiday cookies... I used olive oil instead, brown rice flour & whole wheat instead of any white flour.... splenda instead of sugar and I dipped 1/2 in white chocolate....overall a nice addition to my holiday baking collection
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;henrygirls;5;I am very critical of my own cooking and did not care for these when I first made them. However, I love them now! They have a nice crunch and a great spicy flavor! I should have dipped in white chocolate, but ran out of time - still very lovely! I will make again!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;leah;4;I made 2 batches of these. My second batch, I followed Firefly 08's directiosn on how to mix and they turned out much better as far as density - lighter and crumbly! Yum. Excellent recipe. I'm giving them as Christmas gifts to friends.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;3mcmrmom;4;i have to strongly disagree with firefly's recommendations. first: biscotti are an italian cookie, and italians rarely use butter in their cooking. and honestly, for those with cholesterol issues, oil is the better choice anyway! second: there is no reason to change the directions for mixing the dough. most cookie recipes call for mixing fat and sugar, then adding eggs and any liquid flavorings, and last mixing in the dry ingredients (which have been stirred together) about 1/3 at a time. do not mix thoroughly each time you add the dry ingredients - you should still see a bit of unmixed flour when you add the next bit. that being said, these are wonderful cookies! i did add some chopped pecans and raisins that i soaked in triple sec before mixing in - i like little crunchy, chewy nuggets in my biscotti - and i dredged the slices in cinnamon sugar before the second baking, to give them a bit more crunch. even my rather fussy 18-year old likes these!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;loretta;5;Very good Biscotti recipe. Just about the same as my recipe except this one is a bit sweeter due to the added molasses. The dough was sticky and a little hard to work with but with a little flour on my hands it was ok. I followed the recipe exactly and drizzled with melted white chocolate. I would make this again, but think the gingerbread theme is very seasonal so would probably make this during the holidays.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;lovetocook;5;These are sooo yummy! As others, I substituted (same amount of melted)butter for oil and shortened the first baking time to 15 mins! Perfect! The lovely, spicy christmas smell in the whole house is a bonus!!!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;starshipminivan;5;This was great and perfectly spiced. My Italian grandmother could NOT get enough of these at Christmas! I ended up giving her all of the double batch I baked to freeze. I baked mini biscotti by making it into 4 thinner loaves that I sliced and toasted as usual. The smaller size is great for inclusion on holiday cookie trays.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;devaroni;5;soooo good!!! I dipped one side in traditional gingerbread cookie frosting of 1C powdered sugar and 2T milk. These made me look super fancy at the wives tea, instead of bringing the boring sugar cookies.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;tarav1976;4;I altered a little as I didn't have wheat flour, I used all white. These are easy to make and very tasty. I did drizzle with lemon flavored white chocolate and the result was great. Would recommend!!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;nobodysgirl;3;Well, these did not turn out for me at all. They were heavy and dense, and tasted flour-y and slighlty bitter. I'm not sure if cutting back on the flour would solve all those issues. Seems like there is a little too much baking powder. They rose, and became mishapen on the second bake. I had no problems with stickiness - rather, it seemed dry. The concept of gingerbread biscotti is interesting, but this is not the recipe I need. Sorry. :(
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;tawna;5;super yummy and just right. i used melted margarine instead of the oil.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;cathy;5;Used 3c of flour as others recommended, otherwise it was too sticky. Also baked at 350 degrees.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;azstephanie;5;"This turned out so good! I did double most of the spices and added a 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper. I can't believe how much it made the spices ""pop"". I also added 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda. I got tons of compliments on it when I took it to work. The taste got better the second day. I did dip some of them in white chocolate which tamed the spices but I love the kick. If you like a sweet treat, I would definitely leave the spices alone and follow the recipe as written."
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;alarose;4;Great flavour that lasts, unlike cakey moist gingerbread recipes...and this is key when doing holiday baking weeks in advance!! They pass the test, these will be going in mailers and gifts to family and friends :-) I followed the recipe exactly, lining sheets with parchment instead of greasing.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;bymarce;5;"I made this for Thanksgiving. I really liked it. The ""Cranberry and Pistachio"" and ""Brownie"" biscottis were more popular."
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;rahefter;5;"Delicious and very ""spicy"" ~ turned out great!"
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;cottagrape;5;Used butter instead of oil. They were great.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;stacymcvay;4;I love gingerbread. Biscotti has not ever been a favorite but like well enough. This recipe was very good but I wanted to explain why I didn't give it 5 stars. First, I followed the recipe exactly. The dough was very sticky and hard to manage. I didn't read until later about not over stirring etc. etc. Also, even after letting it cool it still was difficult to cut into 1/2 inch slices without it breaking. Anyway, my opinion is that the recipe is good but the directions need to be altered to include some of the tips in it that would make it easier for a first time biscotti maker like myself to be more successful.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;scottssunshine;1;I did not care for this recipe.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;singingchef;4;The recipe was a little tricky to understand, but the taste is very good. We have made this two years in a row for Christmas, added a bit more ginger.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;mamacita;5;Fantastic flavor! I used oil and gently mixed them. Let the logs cool before cutting into them, it makes them alot easier to slice. Yum!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;christine;5;Perfect for cold weather with a hot drink. I dipped some in white chocolate, and these were very good dipped in tea with a bit of Baileys in it.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;jackiec;4;I followed the recipe exact and I think the oven temp is way too high as others have mentioned, My ends started getting really dark before the middles cooked. Also when mixing the dough it never came to a nice smoothness, it was still very sticky, but I didn't want to add more flour and make them tough. I will try again at a lower temp, hopefully it will be better, the taste and smell are great.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;grandmadiane;5;Fabulous!! I, too, reduced temp to 350, and added 1/2 tsp. of salt and 1/4 tsp. baking soda. The flavor was perfect, no bitterness. I drizzled them with a simple vanilla glaze. These just taste like the holidays, and the whole house smelled wonderful. Thanks for a great recipe!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;mochip;5;I will be keeping this recipe for a long time. I did take the following tips from other reviewers: 1) bump the temp down to 350. 2) add a little more flour (helped to combat stickiness) 3) add a little black pepper for some zip 4) wet my hands to make the dough shaping easier. The flavor was exactly what I hoped it would be. I left some plain and I drizzled some with a simple sugar glaze (powdered sugar, water, vanilla). I'm going to try these with Splenda for my diabetic family and friends. A tip for first timers: the logs spread when baking, so don't put them too close together if you're using one cookie sheet. And I was too lazy to move the baking rack from the bottom to the middle shelf and they got a little browner than I wanted. Good thing the temp was only 350. If it was 375, that laziness could have been catastrophic! Even with these boo-boos, they turned out awesome!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;mpeble;2;This recipe gets points for its uniqueness, but not for its flavor. I followed the directions exactly, but they burnt around the edges and the taste seemed to permeate all the pieces. The texture was very tough and cardboard like instead of crispy and light. They did not look very attractive, but maybe adding stripes of white chocolate would help. Kudos to those of you who can make this recipe work. By the way, a tip for cutting biscotti: the sharper the angle of your diagonal cut, the longer the pieces will be. You can snag the little rounded end pieces for yourself.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;baricat;4;Nice crispy, crunchy, spicy little treats. I followed the recipe as written with the oil, because butter is not normally used in genuine Italian biscotti, which never have a buttery taste. Those who think these taste bland might benefit from the addition of 1/2 tsp salt. Also, adding 1/4 tsp baking soda will keep the spices from giving a slightly bitter edge. If you want the spiciness to have a kick, 1/8 tsp black pepper or a couple of good shakes of cayenne will accomplish what you're looking for. I baked for exactly the time specified (25 minutes,) sliced and baked another 7 minutes per side. They came out properly light, dry and crunchy. Also avoided overmixing, which kept them from turning out tough. Painted the bottoms with white chocolate. Also, used half Splenda and half sugar. Delicious!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;pennyojaschaaf;3;These were a bit bland, some reviewers suggested adding more spices, I will try that next time.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;anjaleck;3;I made this recipe as is, following the instructions and was disappointed with the results. The children didn't care for them much and normally they eat biscotti like it was going to be gone before they can get another piece. I won't be using this recipe again. But I want to repeat... I made the recipe like it's written. I didn't try any of the suggestions from other readers.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;addictedtoallrecipies;5;Made these for a Christmas Cookie Exchange...and they were a hit. I split the dough into 3 logs so the cookies were a bit smaller but perfect for this type of event. I dipped half of the cookie in white chocolate and sprinkled with red and green sprinkles. Great display on the cookie table. Everyone loved the thought of having a cookie that they could have in the morning instead of all cookies that are just for dessert.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;notoriousjen;4;This was my first time making biscotti and I could not believe how easy it was! Everyone liked the amount of spiciness as it was written, but I would double it if I make them again just for myself. I dipped the flat bottoms in white almond bark and drizzled more on the top. They looked really beautiful and I will certainly make them again.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;slogan0687;5;My mom loves these so I've made them a few times now. I usually add about a tsp more of each seasoning. I have replaced the oil with applesauce, and once with margarine. The margarine made it a bit more brittle, but it had better flavor. I find as well that chilling the dough for at least an hour makes it a bit more manageable.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;amy;5;This is one of the five biscotti recipes I used this year at Christms. People loved the gingerbread flavor, especially my husband and father. A friend of mine from Germany was also delighted with the flavor. I was unable to find whole wheat flour in my small town grocery store, so I used regular, but the cookies didn't suffer. Next time I make these, I'll go a bit farther afield so I can make them as the recipe dictates. Thanks for sharing this recipe.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;colleen;5;My family absolutely loved these. My daughter thought they were to spicy plain, however after I dipped them in white chocolate, she said they were the best she has ever had. Great dipped in a good cup of coffee.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;jules;3;These were okay. I don't particularly care for biscotti, but I thought I'd make a few to give as gifts. Waiting until their cooled to cut them is really the trick to making them look pretty. I cut the first batch when they were hot and it just didn't look as smooth. Also, the dough was pretty crumbly/sticky, but loosely wrapping it saran wrap while shaping it and rolling it (I used a rolling pin) makes it a whole lot easier to work with. I'll probably melt some white chocolate to drizzle over them.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;sonyadee1;5;I followed the recipe exactly except that I added some minced fresh ginger to the wet ingredients before mixing. They turned out perfectly. I gave them out at our office cookie exchange and everybody seemed to love them.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;jen;5;Look out Starbucks! This recipe is fantastic. I've made a lot of biscotti in the past, so I decided to use butter instead of oil (1/3C). To get the gingerbread into the right size logs I wet my hands and had no problem shaping them into the desired shape. I baked them for 20min, let them cool for 5min, then cut them and turned them on their sides, baked for 4 more minutes, and they were done. I drizzled white chocolate on them when cool. I will make this over and over again!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;trumpetmom;5;I just love these! Made as written, so need to change a thing. Dipped one side in white chocolate and then sprinkled some red crystallized sugar to make them pretty....I'll make these all the time-very easy!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;amg;4;Not sure why everyone is changing this recipe....make it exactly this way and they will turn out so yummy! My Sicilian Grandmother would be proud. Just have to start watching it around 20 minutes, depending on your oven. If you use a long serrated knife and cut slowly, they turn out great. Biscotti should be a little crumbly when cutting because it gets crispy when it goes back in for the 2nd baking. Remember that baking takes patience and love. Great recipe! Mangia
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;ashes;5;The best!! I followed the directions that one of the other viewers gave and they came out perfect. My husband wouldn't stop eating them! This was the first time I've ever made biscotti's. Excellent cookies.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;rabbit20;5;I made this biscotti last night. I liked the idea of gingerbread biscotti and decided to try it. I'm happy I did. I used canola oil instead and I used 2 cups whole wheat flour instead of 1 and then just 1 and 1/4 cup all-purpose flour. I also added some finely chopped candied ginger. These biscotti had a nice ginger flavour and the texture was great. I did find that I had to increase the second baking time and I flipped the biscotti a few times to make sure they were done.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;digbugsgirl;5;Great recipe. Very easy and everyone loved it. People keep asking me to bake them more.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;karen;5;This was so good! I followed the recipe exactly and had no trouble with it at all. Maybe I'll add a little more spice next time.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;hipgram35;5;This was very tasty ! I did make a minor change by using 6 Tablespoons of butter rather than the oil though. I baked them at 350 degrees for 20 minutes then after slicing I baked them again for 15 minutes. Other than the buuter and baking times I changed nothing else. Will certainly be making these again. I did get out white chocolate to melt and drizzle over them but after tasting them I felt they were delicious as is so I put the chocolate back in the cupboard. Thank you very much for the recipe.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;aliceseattle;5;Everyone just loved these. I iced them with melted white chocolate. I will keep these in my collecion.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;krislovesdonuts;5;This was by far the best, not to mention the easiest, recipe of the cookies I made yesterday. These turned out great. Drizzling or dipping in white chocolate is a must.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;djo;4;These biscotti were really great. I dipped half the cookies with milk chocolate, and half the cookies I dabbed the end in white chocolate.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;tess;5;This was the first time I had made Biscotti. It turned out great! I used white flour only because I had no whole wheat flour at the time. Used my Pampered Chef baking stone. Perfect! Great recipe!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;gfriday;4;I tried a test batch of these for my xmas gift boxes. I think they're a winner. I made them as the recipe called except for adding a little more flour until it came together in my mixer. I also needed to cook them longer than specified. The taste was gingery, but not overwhelming. Be sure to wet your hands while forming the logs, it solves the sticking problem. I'll be drinking hot tea tonight with my first successful batch of biscotti.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;jendrew;5;This was my first attempt at making biscotti, so I can’t compare it to other biscotti recipes. I was pleased to see how easy they were to make and I love them with coffee.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;heatherw;5;This is delicious! I followed the suggestions of the others who mixed the dry ingredients together and then added the wet ingredients (including using butter instead of oil). I also substituted fresh grated ginger (about 1/2 T) for the dry ground ginger. This biscotti was very easy to make, and will be a regular treat during the holidays. Thanks!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;susang;5;Oh my gosh this is wonderful. I did add about another 1/4c flour to kneed with but otherwise followed it exactly. I made these for Thanksgiving party favors. My guests loved them, they are awesome dunked in coffee. These are my new holiday biscotti.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;laurie618;1;Not worth the time and ingredients. There's much better biscotti recipes out there.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;eee;3;"I started out following the recipe exactly, but it was super wet/sticky and did'nt form a dough. I had to add an extra cup of ap flour, knead it a little, and use a 1/4 cup MORE flour (for each ""log"")on my hands and to coat it just to form the dough on the cookie sheet."
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;karla;5;Fantastic recipe! I've made this several time, several different ways, and it's almost impossible to mess up! Since I'm a butter lover, I switched out the oil for butter and also switched out the eggs for 1/3 cup applesauce. I left the rest of the recipe the same. I did cut the cold butter into the dry ingredients as others had stated, and found the dough to come out just perfect and slightly crumbly. The cookies came out perfect too! Not too hard, and not soft. Dipping them in white chocolate makes them the perfect snack and they compliment a cup of coffee wonderfully!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;kfcooke;5;Fantastic! I followed Firefly's advice for mixing the dough, and these came out perfect. After the initial baking, I toasted each side for 10 minutes to make them extra crispy.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;joannah;5;These were a huge hit with my family. I didn't have whole wheat flour so I used all white flour (about 4 cups), and they were still great. Will definately make again!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;tsd1355;5;I have been baking various kinds of biscotti for years and I have to say that this was one of the best doughs I've worked with. They baked up beautifully and the house smelled wonderful while they were in the oven. They also slice very easily without breaking. I increased the amount of spices just slightly to make it spicier and am going to finish them by dipping the ends in white chocolate and adding holiday colored sprinkles.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;jenniferstoremski;5;Super Delicious!! I did make a few changes to the recipes, as others suggested. I substituted 1/2 cup cold butter for the vegetable oil. I first mixed all dry ingredients together, then cut in the cold butter until coarse crumbs. In a separate bowl I mixed the eggs and molasses, I then added it to the dry ingredients. Next I split the dough into 3 equal parts and shaped each into a log, then brushed with an egg wash and baked in a 325 degree oven for approx 22-25 min. (Do not bake in a 375 degree oven or they will burn). I sliced them and baked each side for 5-6 min. Once cool, I dipped each half of the cookie in melted white chocolate. SO YUMMMY!!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;sarah;5;These are super yummy!! I followed firefly's suggestions of using butter and cutting it into all the dry ingredients and then adding the eggs and molasses. If you live in a high altitude make sure you lessen the cooking time. My first batch burned slightly on the edges and bottom. The second batch I baked for 18 minutes, then 6 minutes on each side after slicing. I drizzled with white chocolate that I added a little amaretto to. SO GOOD!!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;valgal;5;These biscotti are delicious as is. But if you really want a treat, add chocolate chips to the batter. You just turned something delectable into fabulous! These are a real favorite with all our family.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;spearl20;5;I made mine just like Raphaella wrote in her review. I think butter is the way to go instead of oil. Also, adding the eggs and molasses last to bring it all together... Try the lemon-flavored almond bark, that makes it extra yummy! However, if you're planning on keeping the biscotti for more than a week, you should know that dipping the biscotti in almond bark causes that part of the cookie to soften a little.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;mccartney4175;5;Very good biscotti recipe. I liked the texture of the cookies, but I might try them using just the AP flour for the whole flour amount just to see the difference. I dipped half the cookie in white chocolate to spruce up the presentation. I might even try adding some chopped up macadamia nuts to the batter next time! Thank you for sharing this recipe :)
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;furelise;5;This one is a keeper! Even my 1 year old loved it! I piped on some glaze (icing sugar and water), which added the perfect little punch of sweetness.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;mallinda;1;I've made biscotti before and understand that they are not sweet like a cookie, nevertheless there was hardly any sweetness to these biscotti, The spice and molasses flavors were good. The recipe says it will make a stiff dough. Well that's an understatement. I was afraid it was going to burn out my Kitchen Aid mixer and finished trying to get the dough together by hand. I think there's far too much flour for the amount of liquid. In addition, the whole wheat flour gave the finished biscotti the consistency of sawdust.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;thecookworm;5;Maybe it's me, but I always like a little bite to my gingerbread so I add a dash (or two in my case) of finely ground black pepper. This is one cookie that I always get recipe requests for. And people are impressed that biscotti is not something that has to be purchased.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;laura;5;I made these for a family get together recently. I'd never made biscotti before so it's safe to say that I didn't really know what I was doing.Everyone agreed that these were absolutely delicious. I'm not a big fan of gingerbread and disliked the strong bite, but everyone else said the flavor was perfect. I will be making these for them again.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;mollyes;5;Fantastic! These came out perfectly. The taste was great & unique enough for people to get excited about biscotti. I brought this to a party with a homemade lemon dip (same recipe as lemon pie filling--I just didn't let it get as stiff as that so that it was easier to dip into). People asked to take the leftovers and also for the recipe.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;joyfullyhis;4;I have never made biscotti before and today I made these. I went by the directions exactly. They turned out very good. :o)
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;judi;5;I loved the flavor of the biscotti and made a few changes. I used butter instead of oil, used 3 1/4 cups white flour and omitted the whole wheat flour and added 1/2 cup chopped crystallized ginger to the dry ingredients. Everyone loved them and said the biscotti tasted like the ones from Starbucks.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;lisameyerpiazza;5;These are excellent! A wonderful alternative to little men cookies or make them any time of the year!!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;sarajane;5;Absolutely yummy! Topped with melted almond bark (Walmart Baking aisle).
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;jennifer;4;I didn't care for these but my son loved them. He ate almost the entire batch over a period of a week and a half.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;lisette;5;I made a batch of these as Christmas gifts and have friends calling just say how good they were. Yum! I melted white chocolate with a bit of almond extract and drizzled it over the top. It looked lovely and tasted even better. Thanks for the great recipe!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;j3luk;5;The mix of spices in this recipe is perfect! I made it with almonds and it was delicioius! I will definitely make this again.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;renee;5;i just made these last nigth and were very good. i did take time and read several reviews. i ended up cutting in the butter flavored crisco (was out of butter) into the dry ingredients and added the wet ones. the dough was crumbly but in the end they turned out great! i dipped in white choc
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;rachealhuber;4;These turned out well. They were not anything spectacular, but good nonetheless. Instead of making then super hard like biscotti- since i knew i would be having people over with delecate teeth, I baked at 350 - like cookies- and didnt return them to the oven. The came out semoi soft like a cookie but not as hard as biscotti- I enjoythem them- and instead of baking it all at once, I rolled and shaped each one into a biscotti stick- I didnt want to bake the entire dough then cut- You can shape the dough into anything. I made candy canes-
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;cobaltboo;5;Wonderful recipe. I followed it to the letter and created lovely, gift-quality biscotti that I shared with my family and co-workers for Christmas. Thanks!!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;masonmama;4;These are pretty good, though I don't really like them solo, they taste best with a beverage.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;denisey;5;Just finished make this recipe for the first time. Followed other's advice and used butter in place of oil. Had no trouble with mixing the dough. I made two logs and baked on pampered chef stone. Turned out great. I dipped the ends in melted white chocolate. Waiting for the chocolate to harded right now before taste testing but the pieces I tried without the chocolate tasted really good. Thanks for sharing:)
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;chelsealukefulliton;5;"All I have to say is ""Yummmmmmy!"" Will definitely be making these again and again."
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;brentkramer;4;I had trouble with this recipe. I made it once just as the recipe calls, but it turned into a puddle on the baking sheet (It did taste good though). I tried it again with 2 1/2 cups of flour, and it turned out great. I dipped them in melted white chocolate with a dash of amaretto and they taste great. I am planning on giving them as gifts for Christmas.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;j;4;Perfect accompaniment for a hot apple cider or coffee at Christmas. I dipped mine in white chocolate and will give as gifts this year.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;shawnessym;5;Awesome. I used 100% white flour and was heavy-handed with spices. Gift-worthy!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;peachmcdouall;4;After reading many of the reviews, I made many of the recommended adaptations to this recipe. I also changed the spice ratio, and used both fresh and candied ginger instead of dried. The results were awesome, but it seems like I'm rating an altogether different recipe. So I submitted the new version to this site for people to try. Folks who had issues with this recipe can try another version.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;geniebohl;5;This recipe is fantastic! The only changes I made were to use butter and follow the derections of a pp about cutting the butter into dry ingredients then mixing the wet ingredients in. I kneaded the dough for about 5 minutes straight before it was the right constistency (it seemed VERY dry at first but just right after kneading). The other change I made was to add a bit of vanilla to the wet ingredients, I just like vanilla. After forming the logs on the stoneware I pressed sugar into the tops. The biscotti came out tasting and looking great. I'm using it for gifts.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;karenm;5;These biscotti are delicious! I made it with oil as stated in the recipe and used all white flour, and they turned out great. Please do not let the oil scare you - you do NOT have to substitute butter, margarine, or shortening. This recipe couldn't be simpler and the oil is the reason! Just add it in. I did bump up the spices, and I dipped the biscotti in melted white chocolate and then drizzled with melted dark chocolate for a pretty effect. Absolutely incredible. UPDATE: I made these for Christmas for some of my co-workers, and ALL of them absolutely raved!! I wrapped them up in colorful cellophane bags from the dollar store, and tied with a pretty ribbon. I will definitely make these again!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;jenkins283;3;Mine turned out okay. I know biscotti should be dry, but mine was not a good dry...too floury when eating it...??? I just sprinkled turbinado sugar on the top - it looks and smells beautiful. I guess when I dip it in coffee, it's better.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;shellym;5;I can't believe how amazing these taste. I made a batch to send to my grandparents for Christmas and ended up eating quite a few of them. I loved them. I think next time I am going to throw in some fresh ginger too to kick up the spicyness. These biscotti go very well with a nice cup of hot chai tea also.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;groggyfrog;3;Not bad. If I were to make it again, I would probably cut back on the flour a bit to make the dough easier to work with. It was a bit too crumbly according to the recipe. Also, the gingerbread taste was a bit subtle. I might try increasing the amounts of the different spices next time too.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;michelle;3;I made this recipe exactly as stated. I didn't love it. I don't think they had enough gingerbread flavor for me. They did have a good crunch, but the flavor was weak. I may try again and add more spices. Okay base recipe.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;boxboxcom;1;this recipe sucked. the time is too much it would have burn everything i took it out 15 min early. lacks flavor
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;wendy;5;Great! Very easy and tasted wonderful! I also drizzled white chocolate on them...so attractive. I froze them to serve over the holidays, if they last that long. May have to make more! I might only suggest a little bit more of the cinnamom and spices.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;jackie;5;amazing recipe, switched the eggs for about 1/3 cup of applesauce and drizzled it with dark chocolate. great!!!!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;melaniehonts;5;"I made these for christmas presents; so far, everyone loves them!"
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;ruthvalencia;5;These were really good. My children and I loved them. My husband didn't, but he dosn't like gingerbread. Very easy to make.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;lindseygilmour;4;OF all the cookies I have made this year, these are my husband's favorite. I dipped them with white chocolate, but I don't think I will next time - they are soo good even without the added sugar! Thanks for the recipe.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;lisa;5;Made with no changes. These are great - nice and spicy! I drizzled them with white chocolate and they look as good as they taste.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;sandycastle;5;Thanks for this wonderful recipe! The texture is lovely and the molasses flavor is perfect--just assertive enough, and not overpowering. I modified slightly per personal taste by omitting the nutmeg and cloves and sprinkling with cinnamon sugar before baking. A keeper!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;lysavander;4;I would've given it 5 stars, but I changed the oil to butter as others suggested. They were delicious! I had to bake mine, once sliced, more than the recommended time to get them crispy enough. I didn't have ground cloves, just whole, so I tried to grind them in the coffee grinder and didn't have quite enough. But still very good! I also followed the suggestions of others by mixing all dry ing. first and then adding the wet. I did have to knead mine quite a bit to get it cohesive. Rolled in raw sugar. Will make again:)
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;slj6;5;Great recipe! Co-workers enjoy these biscotti. I dipped half of them half-way in white melted chocolate and then sprinkled red,white, and green non-perils on them. They looked very festive. Made recipe as stated and was not over powered by the spices. Thanks!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;shariv;5;These turned out really good! I was afraid they'd be too spicy, but I took a chance and didn't reduce any of the spices, and I'm glad! The only change I made was to add about 1/2 bag of white chocolate chips, they went great with the spicy cookie. Mixed it all up in my Kitchen Aid and they were ready to eat in no time! Thanks for the recipe, I'll definitely make it again!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;anastasia;5;This recipe is perfect, just the way it is written. I bake lots of biscotti and have tried several recipes. I use oil in some of them with great results. This one is no exception. I decorated the biscotti with white chocolate laced with lemon flavoring. I may try a batch adding toasted almonds. Outstanding!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;raphaella;4;"I thought this was a great recipe. I did sub 1 stick of butter for the oil, Blackstrap molasses for regular molasses, used all wheat flour and rapidura suger instead of the white. I also followed ""Firefly07""s instructions for how to mix it up They said ""Second, to ensure a crunchy yet not-too-hard texture, I mixed the ingredients according to most biscotti recipes I've tried. I mixed all the dry ingredients, incuding the sugar. Then I cut the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembled course crumbs. In a seperate bowl, I lightly beat the eggs and the molasses together. I added this to the dry mix. I mixed this concoction until it was just combined. No overmixing! The dough should still be crumbly. I divided the dough in half and formed them into their log shapes on the cookie sheets. It's still pretty crumbly at this point, but it all firms up when you bake it. This looser dough allows the biscotti to cook up crunchy without being dense or hard."" Thank you Cristina & Thank you Firely 07..this is the first time I ever made biscotti and it was awesome!"
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;lindalmt;5;Very good. I thought they were going to be too spicy but they weren't, they were great! Excellant with a cup of coffee. Didn't alter the recipe either. I did dust some with powder sugar, smeared the tops of others with white chocolate and left some plain. Nice change from chocolate and perfect for the winter holidays.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;dulcinea54935;5;Reminiscent of a gingerbread man -- great soaked in Christmas type coffees or cocoa or teas
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;jolene;3;These are decent but really need a little more kick! Next time I am going to add real ginger (either crystallized or fresh rather than ground) and some more cloves. Also, they benefited from some icing.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;cookinmama;5;I made these today for Thanksgiving, and it will be a miracle if they last until then. My husband and I both love them. My original intention had been to drizzle with white chocolate, but why mess with perfection? My dough was very sticky, so I added a bit more flour, and I lowered the temperature to 350 degrees. I didn't bother turning the cut biscotti. Magnificent!!!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;mythreeboys;5;This is an excellent recipe. I dipped mine in melted white chocolate to help mellow the spiciness. They were so good dipped in tea!! Thanks for the great recipe
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;cat;5;Wow! What a wonderful and easy recipe. I made these twice and both times they came out perfect. I added a little extra ginger and cinnamon and that gave them alot of great gingerbread flavor. I am sure they would be perfect without the extra. They disappear in 2 days!!! Thanks for sharing this recipe.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;taxifour;5;So good. I've made it many times for my kids who eat it like candy. Could probably back off some on the ginger.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;mrslivingston;5;This recipe is wonderful! My biscotti turned out perfectly and everyone loved them. The gingerbread spices were not too overpowering and paired perfectly with a cup of coffee. Also, very simple. If you can make a batch of cookie, you can make this recipe.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;primes123;1;Temperature was too high. Biscotti were dry and burned on edges. Smelled good and flavor seemed right. Needed less cooking or lower temperature. I will try again with more shortening and all white flour.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;bettymccommon;4;This is a good recipe after I changed a few things from what other reviewers have said and from other biscotti recipes I use. I used 6 T marjarine instead of oil. I omitted the whole wheat flour and ended up using about 4 cups white flour to get the right consistancy. I also added a teaspoon vanilla and used 3 1/2 t. Pampered Chefs Cinnamon Plus instead of all the seasonings, it's just easier as it has all of them in it. Next I divided into 3 logs and rolled them in Raw sugar mixed with a little cinnamon then flattened them. It gave it a nice look after baking. The easiest way to make biscotti is to bake on a Pampered Chef Bar stone(yes there is a difference in stones) They won't burn and when you bake the 2nd time, you just stand them up about 1/2 inch apart and don't have to flip them. I'm not sure if I will do any white chocolate on them or not. They do look pretty the way they are.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;thearchitect;5;Each of the women in my family bakes a Christmas cookie around the holidays. This is the one I bake and it is always the favorite.

e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;katrina393;5;Made these this morning, they came out great. I made 2 changes. First I used 3 1/4 cups of all purpose flour and second, I added 1/2 cup of White Chocolate Chips. Perfect!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;nicolerenee;5;Wonderful, easy recipe. I was always intimidated at the thought of making biscotti, but this recipe was easy and delicious!!

e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;brendaferrierahenden;5;This recipe was wonderful. I have made it 3times since the holidays & have had several people ask for it.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;vanessaf;4;This recipe tasted great, and was a major hit. However, the texture was off each time I made it. The first time was slightly underbaked, causing the cookies to hold together better without being as crisp. The second time, when they were fully cooked, they were fairly crumbly, but still good for dipping. Definitely a recipe that I'll try again, though!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;dmcbride;5;These were the perfect treat to have with coffee on a cold winter day. It was a surprisingly easy recipe. I did end up using 1/3 c. more flour to make the dough easier to handle and I used white, not whole wheat flour because that's all I had on-hand. I dipped one side in white chocolate, which makes for a prettier presentation. I received many compliments on these and plan to make them again.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;mom2wildchild;4;I liked this recipe overall. However, next time I will eliminate the whole wheat flour and use all white flour. While I love to use whole wheat flour most of the time, I thought it competed with the gingerbread flavor. This was also commented on by my friends. The cookies were still very good and the cook times were dead on for me. Thanks for the recipe.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;sarkika;5;I'm not confident in my cooking abilities, but these turned out so wonderfully that I ended up three batches for different Christmas parties. I didn't toast them as much, and every one appreciated biscotti that wasn't dry and crunchy.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;twinkeroo;4;I made a double batch of these biscotti as Christmas gifts for the office, and they were an absolute hit. As suggested in other reviews, I drizzled the biscotti with melted white chocolate after the second baking, though they're quite good plain as well. They could have been a bit more gingerbready, though, so I'll probably add a bit of vanilla extract, ground allspice and finely chopped candied ginger next time around.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;betsywhitmore;5;This turned out great for me. It's a bit softer than most biscotti because of the molasses, but we really liked it. Others who tasted it are asking me for the recipe. I added some dried cranberries to the mix before baking these, and it was a nice addition.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;huskermom;5;YUMMY! I made this recipe for gifts. I dipped half of them in dark chocolate and half in white chocolate then added Christmas sprinkles. I may add more ginger next time but then that is a personal preference.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;jqrollins;5;"Everything they say is true! These are the best. I made around 200 last week for various cookie trays and plates (and personal edification). I did put the white chocolate on one side, and on some, I put the melted chocolate in a piping bag and wrote ""HO HO HO"" on the sides, very cute! Just delicious, making more tonight for Santa!"
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;catnap;3;Smelled good but it was doughy in the center. I baked it twice which helped. This was a very stick dough. If you make it I would suggest making it in a low profile like one inch or less then it might cook through better. I sprinkled it with 10x sugar.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;tinatoodles;4;Very spicy! A little dry but good with white chocolate drizzled on it.

e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;lisaberg;5;These were easy, delicious, and they made a ton. What more could you ask for? I made three kinds of biscotti for Christmas gifts at work this year, and this was by far the favorite. As with others, I found the cooking time just slightly high, causing dark bottoms and ends. Dipping them in the white chocolate made me forget all about the dark ends though and added quite a bit of appeal. I found that adding a tablespoon of shortening to the chips helped make the consistency easier for smooth dipping.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;jpesto;5;This is a five plus! I made several batches of these to give to my neighbors and they were very well received. Perfect biscotti. The only changes I made were to brush the loaves with an egg wash before baking and sprinkle on some red and green sugar. I also did the second bake with the cookies standing up rather than flipping them.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;deesquared;5;Delicious and easy! Fills the house with the smells of Christmas! I dipped them in white chocolate melts, and hubby loved them! I did reduce the baking time, as they were burning a bit on the bottom.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;bfs;5;Delicious! I baked these for Christmas gifts and they were hard to give away. The texture helped them travel perfectly. I found the cooking times to be accurate for a crisp, traditional biscotti.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;cristy;5;this may be the best biscotti I have ever had! I followed the recipe exactly (even the cooking time) and they came out perfectly. I don't know why some others had so much trouble. The dough wasn't sticky at all. Even my 6 year old had one with milk tonight and loved it! This is a keeper. Thanks so much Christina!

Make sure you flatten the dough to 1/2 inch thickness as directed, mine was a little thicker and ended up very doughy in the middle when I cut them, they did cook through when I baked them the second time. I did dip one side in vanilla almond bark. My husband said they were very good dipped in coffee.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;laurdsed;3;I thought that the dough was hard to work with. Definitely grease the cookie sheets and your hands for shaping the dough. It was very sticky! However, the end product was quite tasty. I also took previous reviewer's suggestion and coated one side with melted white chocolate chips.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;natalieevans;5;I love this treat. I think it's great whether or not you bake it twice. I actually like it better slightly softer (by not baking twice). But either way, it received rave reviews when I served it.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;heidiv;4;These were quite good. I only baked for 20 min - 25 would have been too long. Also I only baked for 9 min the second time (didn't turn them and bake again). They were the perfect firmness for me - could eat them without dunking but stayed together when dunked as well. Nice flavour, very gingerbready. Could use a sweet topping to finish them off - I think I'll try an icing on them (like gingerbread cookies). Were a little hard to get all mixed together, but that could have been made more difficult due to the bowl size I used - recommend a nice wide large bowl so you can really get in there.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;haberichter;5;Excellent! All the flavor of traditional gingerbread, but without all the fat. Great to dip in coffee, will definitely be making this one again!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;jessica;4;Nice spicy gingerbread flavor! It's definitely a good recipe to keep (will be splendid for the holidays!). I had substituted 1/2 the sugar with Splenda, replaced 1 of the eggs with egg substitute, and also added 1/4 tsp of all spice for a little extra punch. The flavor was good, could be a bit sweeter, and I definitely had to bake it about 10 to 15 minutes longer to make it crunchy and not too soft. Otherwise, it's delish!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;maggiemcguire;5;Crispy, gingery and delicious. I was somewhat concerned with the large quantity of ginger in these, but turns out they're perfectly seasoned!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;annadunster;5;Very yummy biscotti, great in coffee, good with cream cheese cinnamon roll icing too. 25 mins cooking time was slightly long and I unfortunately didnt check it, but turned out ok, just slightly overcrispy and dark on the ends. I'll watch it more closely the last 5 mins next time.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;angelamclamb;5;This was awesome. Just the right amount of spices for that perfect gingerbread!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;ileneg;3;We enjoy Biscotti so I thought I'd try this recipe. I sprayed the cookie sheets..glad I did. I was hoping for the taste of sweitzel's gingersnap cookies...but the flavor was a little lacking... I even put in more ginger and other spices. I'll see how they taste in a day or so... Back with the next day's report, they had a nice strong ginger taste...definite dunkers. If you want them a little softer, don't bake them laying on their sides.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;kehlergirl;5;These were very good. My family went crazy over them. My sister and I dunked them into a gingerbread tea, which was absolutely delicious. Will certainly make again.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;shancock1;4;These were delicious! I had never made biscotti before, so I decided to give it a try-they were easy and turned out very well. I topped them off with white chocolate and enjoyed the cookies with a cup of coffee. I'll definately be making these again. :)
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;wendykennedy;5;I personally don't know what the other reviewers are talking about (the ones who dissed this recipe). These are dee-lish!! I make them alll the time, and drizzle them with white chocolate. They are to die for!!! These are a staple in my house. In fact, I am having one right now with my tea! :-)
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;pamelalefebvreparkinson;5;This biscotti was the hit of the Christmas season. It was super easy to make and so tasty. Everyone who received it as a gift just raved about it.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;kulawyette;5;These were super easy to make. I made them as if I were making pasta with the well method and my bare hands. I did make them with a wooden spoon the first time, but it didn't come together very well, when I attempted to shape them. Everyone so far has requested these as a Christmas gift or has requested the recipe. Just Fabulous!!!!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;becca;3;The flavor of these biscotti is very good and true to gingerbread, It made the whole house smell like the holidays! I happen to like my biscotti in the Italian tradition-meaning I prefer them to be more crunchy and these were rather soft for my taste, even after elongating the sencond baking time.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;kbill;5;I love gingerbread and thought this biscotti version was excellent. Very tasty!
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;domsmum;5;This is a fantastic recipe. Delicious biscotti that cut very easily and cleanly. I got my biscotti about 9 inches long without cracking or crumbling. The smell while they are baking is heavenly. Wonderful for gifts. I'm going to make another batch of these soon.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;crazycatlady76;4;I thought they were wonderful. The flavors are so intense that a small batch goes a long way, though.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;holtonc;3;a little boring. I don't think I cooked mine long enough because they were not as crispy as other biscotti that I have tried.
e8a8b37a-adb1-457d-a14d-04e0a08d3d18;kloner;1;Smelled great while cooking, but did not taste good. The texture is much too dense.
9b5dc451-896e-4105-a750-a9fd11cabee2;cookingmama;1;I used vinegar and brown sugar and messed it up because I didn’t have tamarind.
9b5dc451-896e-4105-a750-a9fd11cabee2;olliestg;4;Very easy to make, cooked in no time. Defiantly would make again (with a little less tamarind next time).
9b5dc451-896e-4105-a750-a9fd11cabee2;paulaakbari;5;If you appreciate the deep rich flavor that tamarind can bring to a soup, you will enjoy this recipe. Instead of tilapia, I used roasted chicken pieces. Yummy! -Paula Akbari
9b5dc451-896e-4105-a750-a9fd11cabee2;acalzado22;3;Ehhhhhhhh Followed the recipe exactly. It was nothing spectacular, didn't bring me back to the Philippines :( next time I'll try adding the ingredients mentioned in previous reviews
9b5dc451-896e-4105-a750-a9fd11cabee2;cynthoug8;2;It was too sour for our taste.
9b5dc451-896e-4105-a750-a9fd11cabee2;darlingtonusa;4;Nice! I found tamarind paste at Whole Foods. I garlic, ginger, fish sauce, soy sauce to the base and mushrooms, too. The depth of the broth bloomed after about 15 minutes or so, right out of the pot it was still a bit thin. But it was really good, sour, comforting soup. I also added very thin brown rice noodles.
9b5dc451-896e-4105-a750-a9fd11cabee2;jm1024;5;I love sinigang and this is the first time for me to make it with fish.I didn't have tilapia so I used haddock,I used a packet of sinigang na sili powder,added eggplant,batchoy,tomatoes,1/2 tsp patis, and two bullion cubes for added flavor and I loved every bit of it!
9b5dc451-896e-4105-a750-a9fd11cabee2;courtnes;5;I was looking for a recipe that used tamarind instead of the Knor flavor packets that you see in most other recipes. If you're having trouble finding tamarind paste I suggest going to an Arabic or Persian store--tamarind is used a lot in Arabic food along with a lot of other great fruit pastes (apricot, fig, date, etc). I don't much care for the flavor of tilapia so I used shrimp and cat fish instead. I also added some Chinese long beans and sliced limes since that is how my boyfriend's mom makes it. It turned out perfectly. I think this will be my go-to Sinigang recipe. I am planning to make it again with pork ribs to see how it turns out.
9b5dc451-896e-4105-a750-a9fd11cabee2;christierobertson;4;I thought this was delicious. I needed about twice as much water. I used canned tomatoes, added dried sliced shitake mushrooms and a bit of salt.
9b5dc451-896e-4105-a750-a9fd11cabee2;skegeemoncooks;1;I was very excited about making the soup, however, I didn't like. I was very very sour :( My wife hated it.
9b5dc451-896e-4105-a750-a9fd11cabee2;alix;4;I really liked this dish, but I made a few changes to suit my taste. I used regular green cabbage and 1/4 cup lime juice instead of the bok choy and tamarind paste. I also added about 1/3c sliced red onion, 1 tsp beef bouillon, and several tbsp of fish sauce to give the broth more flavor. Very good and different to what I'm used to.
9b5dc451-896e-4105-a750-a9fd11cabee2;breammobunch;4;This is a great tasting, light soup. We are on a strict diet in which we cannot have any oil, bread or starchy vegetables. We found this recipe and have made it twice, once with lime juice and once with tamarind. I liked both versions, but the lime juice was especially good. I added salt and apple cider vinegar to kick it up a notch. Also substituted brussel sprouts once and broccoli once for the radishes. This will become a staple in our house even after we are finished with the diet! Next I am going to add fresh ginger, curry paste and fish sauce to round out the flavor.
9b5dc451-896e-4105-a750-a9fd11cabee2;johnjensannicolas;1;I did not care for this recipe.
9b5dc451-896e-4105-a750-a9fd11cabee2;michelle;5;Love the sour broth, my Filipino friend taught me something very similair to this but I used pressure cooked pork necks for the meat. Also, for the green leafy I used some turnip greens. The taste is great. Sometimes we serve this over rice. Very good on a cold day...
9b5dc451-896e-4105-a750-a9fd11cabee2;plaisham;5;Actually it is unrated. but no where to just ask question first. I have trouble finding tamarind. Can I sub with lemon or lime???
9b5dc451-896e-4105-a750-a9fd11cabee2;rubenzuniga;5;Delicious! My wife is Pinay (I'm Mexican) and she loved it! I was impressed at how satisfying the flavor is, definitly Umami.
9b5dc451-896e-4105-a750-a9fd11cabee2;cellybelly;5;delicious! tasted just like my mom's recipe. i made just a few alterations though...i added about 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, white daikon, and long beans to the mix.
9b5dc451-896e-4105-a750-a9fd11cabee2;gachong;5;I always thought pork sinigang was superior to [ocean] fish until I used [fresh wtaaer]tilapia. This fish has a very delicate flavor and a decidedly un-fishy aroma compared to bangus and over-the-reef fish. Sinigang is awesome comfort food, and as I get older, the more I like it on the sour side. Excellent recipe.
9b5dc451-896e-4105-a750-a9fd11cabee2;nani;5;This recipe is sooo simple yet, delicious. Very satisfying, especially since it's getting colder. I substitute the daikon with brown rice since I didn't have any on hand. Also, instead of the Tamarind paste, I used Worcestershire sauce, since I didn't have any of that either. I will surely make this again.
9b5dc451-896e-4105-a750-a9fd11cabee2;georgia101;4;Great recipe and very simple and quick to make. However, I added some things: 1/2 tsp lime juice, 1/2 tsp red curry paste, a couple sprinkles of salt, and 5 tablespoons of fish sauce. Serve hot over steamed rice...great dish! Just like my grandmother used to make it!
9b5dc451-896e-4105-a750-a9fd11cabee2;daihpos;5;I love this soup. It's light and you would not feel guilty serving along with other main dishes. The original traditional tangy taste calls for tamarind, but lime or tomato is definitely acceptable. Add excitement to your Sinigang by adding prawns, 1/8 cup sliced red onions and 1 tbsp shredded ginger. Some greens like bok choy, or even anaheim pepper (long green pepper) is also good. Since this is soup, I usually add the green veggies sparingly in order not to overpower the character as a soup. Since this is a cultural food, you can deninitely adjust the spices according to your orientation.
9b5dc451-896e-4105-a750-a9fd11cabee2;marie;5;SUPER!!! I love this soup! My Philipino friend has a similar recipe- she adds sliced potatoes and brown rice-cooked. This IS comfort food. My husband is Lebanese and he loves this soup. We make it just about once a week. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! Good Job!!
9b5dc451-896e-4105-a750-a9fd11cabee2;bettycrocker;3;This is a sour soup enjoyed in many Asian households. It sort of tastes like what my dad makes, but it was missing something. I'm not sure what that is yet, but the taste did improve with a couple of tablespoons of sugar. Mushrooms are a good addition to this soup too. I will continue to tweak this until it suits my tastebuds. Thanks.
9b5dc451-896e-4105-a750-a9fd11cabee2;joey;5;Wasn't sure about it when we started but we both loved it and cannot wait to make it again!
9b5dc451-896e-4105-a750-a9fd11cabee2;sandygirl;4;Delicious soup! definately comfort food, but light! I used 1/4 cup fresh lime juice instead of the Tamarind paste cause i just couldn't find any! I also disolved a teaspoon of thai green curry paste into the water for a bit of kick! Needed salt but that can always be added to taste after. Fast tastey dish!
