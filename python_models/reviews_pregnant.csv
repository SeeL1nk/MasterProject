cbb87adf-fae3-4d3e-a34e-1b8ae8344940;marciahiruo;5;Sounds good.If you do not have fresh ginger, can you use ground ginger?
504e390d-d93d-43fc-b3bf-829d5303485b;jenniferedwards;5;Really good and rich even though I only used half the cream cheese, no fontina cheese, chickpea pasta, and milk instead of half and half. Also used grilled chicken strips and skipped the oven.
504e390d-d93d-43fc-b3bf-829d5303485b;joshuaddiazfranco;5;The good things about this recipe is that you can customize it to your liking best. I did it without an oven, since I don't have any, simply cooked all the ingredients separately then mixed them all. What I found is that one half of the cheese is more than adequate if not oven cooked, otherwise is great delicious.

51ae3e99-d39a-4581-afbd-88bdac4f5f04;nicolekletzka;5;This was delicious and easy to make.
4a418504-e16c-4fbb-95d9-b5888508157b;helend;5;Very good! The family (with varying tastes) all liked it. I used store-bought tortilla chips crumbled on top, instead of the tortilla strips. Also offered sliced green onions and sour cream as additional toppings. Very tasty, easy & quick -- a keeper!
93fd7ec6-6b51-4197-94bd-9fce42e93eb6;mort;5;I made this recipe exactly as directed. It was was delicious. I especially liked the strong umami flavor of the glaze. I served it with roasted broccoli. Excellent!
0d1b175c-4299-4b05-a479-146d9aa10460;oneota77gmailcom;5;This was delicious, even without the Parmesan. My 10 year old went back for thirds! I added smoked paprika as that is what we had on hand. Will definitely make this again.
0d1b175c-4299-4b05-a479-146d9aa10460;nichkj;4;I know it says 8 servings but how much is 1 serving? 1 cup? 1 1/2 cups?
61103775-1429-4a5b-8560-5df858885d84;susanquinn;1;No I didn't make it because some directions are weird. Says to take 6 cups of cooked rice (how many people is this supposed to serve?) which seems like a lot.Then a serving size is 1 cup? At that rate, we'd starve. That means that the calorie count is much higher than the 417 calories stated because we'd need to eat more than 1 cup.And I have found that a lot of the Eating Well recipes are far too tasteless so if I were to make this, I'd jazz it up a LOT!
61103775-1429-4a5b-8560-5df858885d84;ericapowell;2;This recipe took way longer than stated in the directions to prep and cook. 6 cups of cooked rice was way too much, I think it made it take longer in the oven for all the ingredients to bake together (40 mins), and it made it dry. I would reduce the rice to 3 cups like others have commented above to see if it comes out better. I unfortunately will not be making this again.
61103775-1429-4a5b-8560-5df858885d84;gesataline;5;I have made the recipe twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. It looked and tasted delicious. It‚Äôs hard to go wrong with some cream cheese, sour cream and a bit of real bacon.The second time I used what I had on hand. I subbed barley for the brown rice and cauliflower for the broccoli. I kept everything else the same. It was an even bigger hit It‚Äôs definitely a keeper for our Fall and Winter cozy suppers.
61103775-1429-4a5b-8560-5df858885d84;roxy;1;I wasted valuable money, time & excitement for this recipe :(. Pay attention to the 1 star reviews. I LOVE this app. But I am devastated this recipe was such a cshow. I can‚Äôt afford to buy these ingredients where the recipe brings me to a complete mess.
61103775-1429-4a5b-8560-5df858885d84;llamacat;4;I'm not sure why Eating Well is publishing casserole recipes in August (isn't it grilling season?), but I decided to try this and it turned out delicious. I used only 3 cups of cooked rice and agree that 6 cups would be too much rice. If this is a misprint in the recipe, please fix it! The only other change I made was I did not add sour cream, because I forgot to buy it. Instead, I added about 1/4 c of heavy cream that I happened to have in the fridge, because I was worried it would be too dry without the sour cream. Reminds me of the chicken broccoli casserole my mom used to make, but tastier and healthier! Gonna try the creamed spinach and chicken casserole next week.
61103775-1429-4a5b-8560-5df858885d84;jljenna;4;It's it 6 or 3 cups of cooked rice??!! Says 6 but someone says otherwise. I just made 6 and it does look like too much! I don't think it says the right amount of broth either! 1/4 is absorbed the minute you put it into a pot of three (or 6) cups of rice! I'm trying a cup and a quarter. The broccoli won't get tender without liquid.
61103775-1429-4a5b-8560-5df858885d84;jamie;5;Delicious just make sure you only make 3 cups of cooked rice for the recipe I might have misread the recipe but I figured it out before it was too late. Very flavorful highly recommend.
734dfb7c-1728-40fe-9274-ca5c249db610;egvdropsouo;5;Very tasty üòã
734dfb7c-1728-40fe-9274-ca5c249db610;helenp;5;This was a bit labour intensive but so worth it! I made no changes to the recipe. Very flavourful. I froze the leftover chipotles for the next time I make this. Based on family reviews that will be soon.
f9b7d664-4b4c-4ffa-9e37-92a7ae9189f2;egvdropsouo;5;Ok like mine better
8e5297e8-b7fe-47b6-83a4-3f8fac243177;deb;4;Great recipe. I can't wait to try it. Disappointed however that you are promoting the use of inflammatory oil such as grapeseed which is so harmful to human health. Olive oil is the go-to for salad dressings!
7909d923-f0c3-408b-bea2-e6febd3d8c6a;jangle5757;5;It seems unfair to rate as I did not follow the recipe exactly though it was close. First off, I realized I was out of balsamic vinegar but I did have white balsamic so used that. Then I was halving the recipe so rather than have a half of a 28oz can of tomatoes leftover, I used a can of plain tomato sauce and added chopped up fresh plum tomatoes that I peeled. I also dislike fennel and red pepper so those were omitted but left in the garlic and basil. I also did not have the ricotta salata so I just grated some Romano cheese over it though I would like to try it with the ricotta salata. I really liked what I ended up with and even went back for seconds. It was a new way to use eggplant that I recommend.
7909d923-f0c3-408b-bea2-e6febd3d8c6a;davidkotchan;5;This is really great, and easy to make. I increased the tomato paste a little (to my tastes), but otherwise the recipe is delicious as it stands.
44f41e28-6682-4f81-931a-70c2e0aeb194;stephanie;3;I prefer to know what is in my salads, however I understand that many people are very rushed for time and want something quick and nourishing.
44f41e28-6682-4f81-931a-70c2e0aeb194;dumplin24;1;I think the recipe is a cop out. The ingredients aren‚Äôt listed, most of them are in a random grocery item which could be different depending on which store you purchase them from. Bad form!
e4b6c99e-30ec-4422-80e8-194a6d06aaff;lenorajohnson;5;It was delicious and a bit addictive for me‚Ä¶I loved the various textures in the sandwich and how the flavors came together. It‚Äôs also very filling
e4b6c99e-30ec-4422-80e8-194a6d06aaff;draytonmoore;5;Fabulous
1053507b-0ff9-489a-a23e-62a56d2824bd;shaki;5;I haven't prepared it yet. But. I love all the ingredients.

9cf624d3-3b7a-41f6-9617-ed043c0162f2;shalenaali;5;Amazing, tasty and refreshing. I used whole geera instead of ground. I used sweet onion. I additionally added fresh cilantro, boiled channa and pomegranate seeds. Came out wonderful.
9cf624d3-3b7a-41f6-9617-ed043c0162f2;penelope;5;This salad used to be my go-to on road trips when we didn't have a lot of food options and would stop at McDonalds. I made it last night for my family and set it up like a salad bar so everyone could make their own and choose their own ingredients. The dressing is very zesty, the 11-year-old gobbled the salad up. I used leftover chicken that I had in the fridge, which was so convenient. Next time I might try grilling the chicken for some extra flavor.
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;ellentresidder;5;I made two of these crustless quiches, one exactly as written and the other with ham, roasted red bell peppers, and cheddar. They cooked together in the oven with 15 extra minutes of cooking time and came out delicious! I‚Äôll be making this recipe again for sure!
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;rinasartain;5;Super tasty. Didn't even miss the crust!
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;sheridan;5;This is the best crustless quiche recipe I have ever used! Best flavor, best texture!
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;margaretsmith;5;I have made this multiple times it's my go to for quiche. Best when I can find a medley of mushrooms, which really adds to the flavor. I use freeze dried thyme since it's easy to keep on hand. I've mixed it up also with ham, cheese and spinach. This recipe is so versatile.
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;terrid;5;Delicious! I love that it‚Äôs made without crust, and the flavor is so full and deep. We had very fresh thyme which made the dish delightful. I made it as instructed no substitutions. I definitely will make this again and again.
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;debmartin;5;I will definitely make again. I substituted dry thyme and 2% milk but still good.
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;donna;5;ABSOLUTLY delicious! Only swapped out Almond mild for milk and cream, used 1 tsp dried thyme and used light Mozzarella shredded cheese to make dish lighter in calories! This recipe will be a regular go to recipe for me!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;brookeit2gmailcom;5;This was amazing in every single way! My husband kept thanking me, for hours after dinner üòÜ. I usually have to ask if he likes something we have for dinner.I used a dried wild mushroom medley with 5 types of mushrooms (reconstituted beforehand), and I did use a refrigerator pie crust because we had one on hand (and it sounded good ) Otherwise I followed the recipe to a T. Soooo delicious!
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;velvetmask;5;I would like to use this recipe for tart-sized quiches for a High Tea that we're hosting over the Christmas holidays. Does the quiche freeze well? It would be convenient to make it in advance and cook it on the day of the Tea.Thank you,Lynn
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;marcylanesaleh;5;I really love the Dijon & Thyme in this quiche.
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;caitlynkraszewski;5;Made this today ... just subbed smoked Gouda for the gruyere. Loved it! My one year old son ate it all too ! Look forward to making it again.
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;goycrazy;5;I made this with 1 cup fontina and 1/2 cup havarti and used skim milk instead of whole. So good! You really don‚Äôt miss the crust.
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;carlitosway;4;It was pretty good and easy to make. Let's not get crazy though, I did miss the crust.
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;deborahniels;5;My family loved this quiche!!! It was especially great for a friend that has diabetes, because it did not have a crust. She absolutely loved it also. The only changes I made was I added more spinach (fresh that I sauteed in a little EVOO, and did not chop), extra portabella mushrooms, sauteed first, and extra gruyere cheese. I also used non-dairy milk (coconut, cashew, almond) and non-dairy creamer in place of half & half.
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;zaravasilvasil67;5;I did it today and ate it .. it's so delicious
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;daveg79663;5;It is extremely well and very helpful thank you.
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;sbrown5816;5;I have had this recipe saved for quite some time and finally made it for dinner yesterday. Used cremini and porcini mushrooms and swiss cheese instead of gruyere. It was easy to make and fairly quick sans no crust, the end result was delicious. Added a sprinkle of nutmeg on top before baking and served with a simple wedge salad. A nice change for a weekend dinner. Will finish the rest for a simple Sunday lunch.
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;sheridan;5;"This is an excellent quiche! It stands up to quiche with a crust because it is very flavorful and has a dense, full texture. It generously fills a 9"" pie pan. I have made it several times without making any changes to the recipe, because as-is, it is delicious!"
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;carolanoneill;5;Started making something similar to this several weeks ago. Just spinach, mushrooms, eggs and a bit of whatever cheese I had on hand. However I fell for the 'quinoa is good for you' mantra and added quinoa as a crust like base to make it seem more like a quiche. I bake for 25 to 30 minutes and then once cooled I cut in brownie size portions and store in the fridge. I have enough servings for a quick breakfast before work for a whole week. I usually add a splash of Choulala sauce for that added kick. It's quick to nuke in the microwave for about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes and I have a proper, quick and nutritious breakfast. I don't add any milk to the eggs but I may experiment with some of the suggested seasonings.
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;alisonmcculloch;5;Absolutely loved this! Will be part of the regular rotation! Made as directed. Served with a salad. My only complaint is many recipes, including this one, do not identify how many servings the recipe makes. So when I have one slice, is it 1/8 of the pie or a 1/6? Hard to figure out the nutritional information if you choose to have another piece without all the facts.
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;donna;1;I enjoyed the ease of this recipe, however, the flavor was lousy. So sorry, but we ended up tossing the entire quiche. It lacked flavor.donna
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;atunnessen;5;Made this as written and we all loved it.
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;familiapaniagua;5;Amazing delicious
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;rosegarretson;5;"This is a wonderful recipe that is bursting with flavor! It's easy to make, and you can even make ahead and gently reheat it.Thank you for posting this! Initially I had thought to add bacon - but I'm glad I didn't, because with the mix of mushrooms, the flavor is ""just right"". This is definitely going to be in my line-up frequently."
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;wham;5;This is a great recipe thank you Julia!! I have been watching sat fat for the past few years and now paying attention to sodium. In mine I used original coffee mate instead of cream, egg whites with only 2 yolks, applewood smoked Gruy√®re and my mushroom mix was 2.6 oz each of oyster, cremini and shiitake mushrooms. I also added a little cayenne because life is bland without itüëç! Just make sure to let it rest well before cutting into it so everything melds and liquids settle!
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;mikephillips;5;My family loves this recipe. Best one I have found!
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;hackeronetest;4;Mmm. Awesome.
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;lanettefisher;5;I just served this to my family and we are only sad that I didn't make more. This is delicious!
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;suzyq;5;This recipe is delicious. Tried the mini-quiche similar recipe made in muffin pan, but this was easier and less messy. Five stars!
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;kathymcclellan;5;Was delicious. When combining mushrooms and spinach mixture to eggs and milk, I added 1 1/2 T capers or to taste.
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;monicadesai;5;This was soooo good! I used baby portobello mushrooms and cooked until tiny. Very delicious.
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;karen;5;Made it as directed and it was outstanding ! The best crustless quiche hands down!
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;bstr1;1;I really wanted to like this recipe... I tried. I remained positive but my husband said... Hmmm, it's rubbery. Indeed it was. It was beautiful, smelled delicious, but the texture was very unappetizing. I followed the directions exactly. We each had a slice and then tossed the remainder.
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;wellfam;5;Made this quiche for breakfast today. Went together so easily. My husband and I loved it. Will definitely be making again..
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;heidi;5;This is a spectacular recipe. I made it according to the recipe and it was gorgeous. I told my husband that this was going to become a staple in our household! The recipe is even more delightful, given its healthful ingredients and low calorie count.
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;meganos;5;The combination of wild mushrooms and gruyere cheese really elevates the flavor of this quiche.
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;makaylahh;4;I like it, I added different seasonings though. It‚Äôs a little dry, I wish it has some sauce or something
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;arianadee;4;I liked it! I did add a can of Rotel with diced green chilies to amp it up a bit, and I swapped in spinach for the kale, plus added celery salt.
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;mrsnamarith;4;I love a one-pan meal! especially when it's NOT the usual pasta or rice. Instead of cooking everything in liquid, like most one pot meals, each component is saut√©ed, giving some nice browning. I knew we would not like that much cumin or poblano, so I used Italian seasoning instead, leaving out the poblano pepper. It's hearty and satisfying.
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;nonna;5;We loved this recipe! My husband said he'd eat this every day!! I substituted spinach for the kale. I found the recipe a bit dry so I used a 14 oz can of petit diced tomatoes, including the juice.
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;cgreco;5;I wanted to use up the ingredients this called for and was skeptical but this was delicious :) Used spinach instead of kale.
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;alasinisellesin;3;The recipe was okay. Kind of bland so I added more seasoning-garlic powder and onion powder-and dry. I feel like it‚Äôs missing a sauce to go with it and perhaps another starch such as a tortilla. Or probably an acidity note to help enhance it-so squeeze some lemon or lime at the end (I didn‚Äôt think about this because I was so hungry). Just some suggestions.
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;jesscoplans;5;This was very yummy! My husband added garlic salt to the potatoes and it all had nice flavors and textures. Sort of felt like breakfast for dinner-I wonder how it would be with scrambled eggs on top?
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;tammy;5;Couple extra steps that defeats quick weeknight meal, but worth it. Browned flat iron steak (on sale) instead of ground beef, remove from pan, tent & let rest before slicing thin strips. Keeping browned bits in pan, Saut√©ed peppers & onions, (did not add garlic yet) remove veggies from pan. Added 2 tsp oil to pan, saut√©ed sliced mushrooms & one cubed zucchini. Removed veggies from pan, added splash of olive oil, 1 TBS tomato paste w/2-3 tsp Italian seasoning, heat for approx 2 min on low heat stirring constantly. Stir in garlic approx 30 seconds, add 1/4 cup red wine. Reduce for approx 2-3 minutes stirring constantly then added all ingredients back to pan including juices from meat, salt & black pepper to taste, simmer on low stirring occasionally 5-10 minutes. Added fresh spinach the last couple minutes.
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;matts;3;Like several others, I thought the recipe is missing something. But it is hard to pin down what. I added sweet paprika. That helped. Then I added some Adobo powder. That helped a lot more. But, until I figure out what this really needs I am not likely to make it again.

53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;amiesawyer;5;Was so good! My whole family raved about it!! Added my own spin with a can of cream of mushrooms and topped with an egg. Also used some previous comments and added some Worcester sauce and balsamic vinegar. My only regret was I didn't make more!
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;robinnaviaskyredding;4;This is good, and I'm always looking for a way to use kale. It just needs something--that unami taste? I added a splash of Worcestershire sauce, but it still wasn't right. Then a splash of balsamic vinegar. That helped. I would make it again, but probably add some balsamic vinegar.

cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;timrisenhoover;5;Love this as written, but since this is the internet I did make a couple of modifications. These modifications were to lower the calories. First, used 90% lean bison meat. Then only one cup of whole wheat elbow macaroni. Also skipped the olive oil and just cooked the onion with the bison. I added a jalape√±o pepper and a bit of Tabasco and loved it.
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;marisa;5;I wonder if anyone has added kidney, pinto, or cannelloni beans??
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;kristina;5;I been making this for years. It's my comfort food of choice. I use wheat elbows, low sodium broth, unsalted petite tomato and sauce, garlic, paprika, pepper, Italian seasoning, corn, onion, olive oil, and lean ground turkey. Dash of parmesan cheese.Someone suggested olives! I'm going to try adding that next. Maybe sub the corn. Either way, healthy and fulfilling
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;deannafortney;5;Stuck to this recipe almost completely and my family loved it. I did precook the noodles separately because I was concerned they would not cook and take all the liquid. They were al dente and I mixed them in and they came out great. This will be a regular go to as it was a quick meal to make
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;judygoldin;3;I haven't made this yet but it looks delicious. Can you tell me what tomato sauce is in British English. To me it's ketchup? Could somebody answer me üôè please?
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;susan;4;My Mom made something similar growing up. I'm not sure where to make this comment, but I would love it if @eatingwell would add a 'notes' section to your recipes so we can make notes of any changes we make to the recipes. Thank you!
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;sooooobored;5;It was a hit! I substituted crushed tomatoes for the other tomato ingredients.
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;mschristine51;1;"My mother made ""American goulash "" for 60 years and I've made it the last 40 years also and it NEVER contains Italian seasoning. Unfortunately you have misrepresented this recipe. Savory ingredients are used in the American version of goulash NOT Italian."
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;dftaylor;5;So easy to make and was very tasty! I made a couple of minor changes - 1 tsp. paprika, no italian seasoning (not a fan), and added about 1/4 cup of ketchup (my mom always used ketchup when I was growing up). I love that you cook the noodles in the same pan. My husband and I both had two helpings!
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;iamdatsechic;4;I followed this recipe to a T. Came out as expected but using the unsalted dice tomatoes and unsalted tomato sauce made it a bit bland. I might change it up by using Italian diced tomatoes and low sodium tomato sauce. The elbow macaroni works fine but maybe penne would be better otherwise a great recipe
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;pradeepmandgaonkar;5;I will definitely try it it looks sooo tasty üòã
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;pparker01967;5;I've been making this dish for 35 years and before that, eating my Mom's version. I have to say, this is pretty spot on. I like it. I don't like paprika though. So I will omit that. Just my taste.
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;pamelataylor;5;I‚Äôm making this as we speak . I like another poster use a whole can of tomato sauce. I‚Äôm going to use rotini pasta cooked separately instead of elbow because sauce adheres to it better. Smells delicious.Fresh basil for a garnish is very tasty with tomato recipes.
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;lv2cook4;5;This meal was easy to make and a hit with the family! I used penne and it could have cooked longer and use more broth. Other than that, will make again!
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;candyo;5;Thank you! This is it. Tastes exactly like the Goulash my mom made when I was a kid. Unfortunately, she couldn‚Äôt even remember the dish she made and that my sisters and I loved. Only change I made was to use a 14 oz can of tomato sauce as I always want to use an entire open can of just about anything. My girls loved it, too. I can‚Äôt wait to make it again!
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;yumfood;5;Easy family meal. Used Rotel tomatoes. Kids loved it. A high end hamburger helper.
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;kelly;5;Didn't make any changes. But used half Hungarian sharp and Hungarian sweet paprika. Really tasty and easy to make. I love one pot meals. Will definitely make again.
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;lhinestx;5;This is a frequent family dinner. It‚Äôs easy and healthy. I use ground chicken. Very nourishing and the whole family likes.
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;leavis;5;Delicious recipe. My innovations included penne pasta made from millet to add protein and ground chicken instead of ground beef. Also ditched the salt. An easy substitution for Italian seasoning - 1 tsp each dried thyme, oregano, basil leaves. And lastly I added some crushed red pepper.
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;migizi;5;In New England we called it American Chop Suey
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;cherryalbinopeters;5;I did not make any changes. It's tasty
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;kris;4;It's a good recipe but I'd never call it goulash. That's something else entirely, according to my German grandmother. This is what we called a homemade version of hamburger helper and we had it a lot and loved it.
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;willaburney;4;This recipe turned out well for me. I used the fire-roasted diced tomatoes for a bit of extra flavor, and white pepper instead of black, as that is my preference. It did have kind of a sweet flavor to it, and I would have liked it to be more savory. Looking at the ingredients, I'm not sure how that came to be. Overall, a hearty, satisfying dish.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;girlofthewest;4;This was a decent recipe. Here's how I would improve it though:1) Cook it a little longer, simmer for another 30 minutes to get those flavors mixing.2) Add 16 drops Melinda xxxtra hot habenero sauce to the pot.3) If your not cooking this as a vegan dish, fry up a couple sunny side eggs in a quick spray of oil and top them in the bowls before serving they add protein and a bit of richness to the dish to thicken it up a bit.Otherwise, pretty good.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;imladyred;5;I like sweet potatoes with lots of calories (butter, brown sugar, honey, etc.) so I wasn‚Äôt sure how I‚Äôd like them mixed with all the savory/spicy ingredients. But I was very, very surprised at how fantastic everything came together. I‚Äôm not vegan, but at least once in a while, I will be!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;michelleburton;5;I made this chili today. I wanted that fire-roasted taste, but was out of fire-roasted tomatoes, so I added a tablespoon of fire-roasted fajita cooking and seasoning blend by Spice World. Delicious!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;suekohlert;5;We had a chili cook-off at work. I made a traditional chili but wanted to make something for my vegan coworkers and chose this. I hadn't planned to enter it in the contest but did on a whim - why not? Guess what? It won!!! I highly recommend this. You won't even miss the meat!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;desertcat76;4;It was delicious and super-easy to make. We used frozen sweet potatoes and those tasted great. The only problem was that I accidentally put 4 tbsp chili powder in there. Eeek! My mouth is on fire and we ate 30+ min ago. Just watch your measurements and you'll be fine. Enjoy!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;erickd;5;This is an absolutely delicious chili recipe. I found it while looking for recipes my vegetarian daughter would enjoy, and it became a huge hit for the whole family. We now make it at least once a month.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;janineharder;5;I don‚Äôt like chili much so I cut chili powder and cumin in half. Added tsp cinnamon. Really delicious!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;kamilahkent;5;I really enjoyed this recipe. I subbed sweet potatoes for butternut squash and added beef + Italian sausage. I also added some freshly chopped kale for some more nutrition. It was soooo good!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;katy;5;Tasty! Prepped by baking 3 large sweet potatoes (I added 2 more) 425 until nearly done - 20 minutes or so. So easy to peel. Decreased cooking time. Made the recipe much easier. Will make again . . . and again.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;raydove9;5;Picky husband loved it! So filling. We ate with rice and cornbread
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;sleepinbeauty06;5;"I made this for the second time tonight and it didn't disappoint. Flavorful and delicious. My friend who is averse to ""vegan"" meals I blackened a few shrimp and it was a hit for him. This will definitely remain in the rotation.#testingvegan (lol)"
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;wls26ce95876ef4;5;I made this for a soup party and everyone asked for the recipe
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;casardinhayahoocom;5;Probably the best tasting vegetarian chili I have made! I used one can of black beans and one can of pinto beans to use up what I had. It seemed a little watery at the end, but solved that using an old trick I learned from another cookbook way back: use a fork or slotted spoon and mash up some of the beans against the side of the pot, and mix in. This adds enough starch back into the water so you don't have to add any other thickener. I love ground chipotle. If you can't get ground chipotle, you can add some chipotle hot sauce which is often found in the Latin/Mexican sections of grocery stores, or use Cholula or Tabasco brand chipotle hot sauce.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;lindsayban;5;This was pretty delicious. I did though change things to the way my family likes their chilli. I didnt use chipolte peppers since one I didn't have any and two not a huge fan. I subbed it for smoked and regular paprika. I also used rotel instead of canned tomatoes and a small tomato paste. I added in kidney beans and butter beans for more protein why not. I roasted my sweet potato before with thinly sliced onion that i then added at the end so it would retain its shape. added some cinnamon. but all in all its a great base. like another reviewer said they mashed the beans ever so slightly to get that thicker texture. all in all will have this again.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;rangerskadi;5;Very tasty. I added a fresh jalape√±o and used a bit more than 1/2 a tin of chipotle peppers and about 500g of minced pork which I browned with the onions / jalape√±o. One can of black beans- that‚Äôs all I had - was just the right amount for me. Delicious, nutritious and satisfying meal! I‚Äôm very happy I decided to try this out.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;mandyhollisreyes;5;Added ground turkey. Yummy!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;igster101;5;So so good and so easy to make. I am not a fan of meatless or vegetarian. This changed my mind.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;experimentingcook;5;This one's a staple at our house - LOVE it! I always make a quadruple batch so there's plenty to freeze for future meals. We can't do spicy so I have to leave out the chipotle but I do add 2 tsp of *smoked* paprika (not the regular kind) to my quad batch to make up for it. My husband prefers meat in his chili so I brown a pkg of ground turkey in a quad batch. At a friend's suggestion, I also add pumpkin (4 c. for a quad batch 1 c. for a single batch). It does wonders for the consistency and it blends perfectly with the sweet potato so you don't even notice it. (I always let it simmer for at least a couple of hours, usually more.) I've made this for a potluck vegetarian and vegan friends would be attending (w/out the meat, of course). Even the meat-eaters loved it. I've shared the recipe with lots of other people and am taking a batch to friends tonight who just brought home a new baby.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;theresa;5;I love love love this recipe. This is my 5th time making it. For the most part I stick to the receipe and really enjoy it. Tonight I added ground turkey. Cooked it separate in a pan and then added it when you add the beans and tomatoes. I use the fire roasted tomatoes. Very wholesome, great for a cold night, a football game.. try it, you‚Äôll like it.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;johnartise;5;My girlfriend and I just tried this recipe tonight. This is by far one of the most spectacular chili‚Äôs we've had in a very long time. The combination of all these delectable, and perfectly balanced flavors totally blew our minds! It has been officially added to our personal recipe list! Thank you so much for conjuring up such culinary magic!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;elizabeth;5;Excellent recipe for people who eat low calorie but want all the flavor! I did not have Chipotle but I did have a can of Bush's black bean fiesta which is in mild chipotle sauce and I also added a jalapeno to give it a little bit more spice and some corn during the time the tomatoes were added to the recipe.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;jennaengelhardt;5;This was incredible! I told everyone the recipe. I used 3 sweet potatoes & used cayenne pepper (a dash) instead of the pepper specified.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;katherinerickard;5;This is one of the best chili's I have ever made. The flavors are fantastic and it makes a nice thick cold weather soup. You do not actually need the dutch oven, I do not have one and just used a regular pot.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;dianebolton;5;Made it for church Potluck, got 1st place award. I would like to add cooked lentils in the chilli but not too sure what you suggest for the measurment of lentils and probably recommend to mix it at the end. Please let me know what you suggest. Thank you so much for all you yummy healthy recipes. Love it
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;vickybruhn;5;I loved loved loved it! I made no changes. It tasted amazing!!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;nmchilecat;5;Wow! For a meatless chili, this was surprisingly good! I used homemade chicken stock instead of water also, I used 2 chipotle chiles in adobo sauce instead of the dried. I don't know about the 4 servings thing...it made 6-8 servings. I served it with Vinegary Cole Slaw from this site, and homemade cornbread muffins. So good! Will definitely make again!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;maggieclinton;4;Oh my word!!! Amazing. I added a full 28oz can of diced tomatoes and used about half the water. Also added about 1tbsp of smoked paprika and 2 chipotle peppers in adobe sauce which gave it a really smoky kick. It could probably serve 5. I only gave it 4 stars because I think the add ons made it 5 star.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;leslie;5;I just made a quadrupled this recipe (with some slight variations because of what I had) and it is fabulous. There are not many recipes that work out so well when upping the quantity! 1) I used dried black beans that I soaked the day before - I tend to think they taste much better than canned and are paraben free. 2) I used cumin seeds because I didn't have ground, and 3) I used a spicy Hungarian paprika that I had in the house instead of Chipotle.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;jessica;5;Turned out delicious, quite spicier than I thought so I'm glad I didn't add any green chili as planned! Served with rice and my boyfriend loved it. Served leftovers with shrimp added! Definitely will be making this again!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;dianne;5;Made no changes and....Y.U.M!!! Have saved to favorites, definitely will make again!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;dg87;5;This has become a lunch staple for my fiance during the winters. We make a big batch and it stays delicious throughout the week.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;jennifer;5;One of our go to recipes. We chop up a chipotle from a can instead of using the powder. I think it gives it more smokiness than the powder. We double this every time we make it.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;jillweignerlong;5;Quick, easy, and delicious. I used rotel instead of plain tomatoes and added a pinch of cinnamon per other reviews. Will make again!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;slyist1;5;My new favorite chili! I substituted the regular chili with hot mexican style chili powderr , it adds a nice kick. But great with regular chili also. I also thickened my chili with a little tomato paste. Its a winning recipe for sure. One of my favorite go tos in the winter.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;kylelaurenscottbouknight;5;I will definitely make this vegetarian chili again...it's simple to make and very delicious. The ingredients are also easy to locate at the supermarket...and very affordable. We did not miss the ground turkey or Italian sausage that I normally put in my chili. I added a bit of cinnamon (after reading one of the reviews) and my, oh my...what a delicious pot of chili! Cole slaw was the side salad, along with a thin slice of whole wheat toasted French bread.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;christyyoung;5;This will be on our list to make again. It was full of flavor, filling, and comforting. My husband prefers meat but he took seconds of this dish. I appreciated that it was not hard to make.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;cindydiamond;4;I put in one can of beans (no tomatoes yet) and pureed a portion of the mixture. This created a creamy base. Then, I added the 2nd can of beans, the tomatoes and a can of all natural pumpkin puree. In the spice mixture, I included 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. This creates a earthy and slightly sweet offset to the smoky flavors. Really tasty!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;christino;4;I used all the ingredients called for in the recipe. The only thing I did differently was cooked the onions and then added everything else in and let it all cook until done. Doubled the recipe, glad I did for next days dinner. Yes, we will make this again.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;lucymcasale;5;This is my favorite chili recipe! I add an extra can of beans and jalape√±o peppers :)
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;marnechia;5;Looooove this. I used crushed tomatoes and lemon juice. No Chipotle so used hot pepper seasoning. Tastes like chili!!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;dobiegirl;5;Delicious vegetarian recipe. To up the heat a bit, add chopped jalape√±o peppers, more chili powder(s). Fresh cilantro also adds flavor

d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;melburta;5;I added cooked quinoa at the end to make this a bit more substantial (and half the amount of chilli powder). This is so tasty and easy! Will definitely become a staple in our house!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;sophie;4;ITS A KEEPER This was a super easy recipe which we all loved. Made it for meatless Monday and saved enough for Meatless Wednesday. Very tasty over rice. I imagine it could be made into a faux sloppy Joe recipe with bread or a soup by adding broth or water. It's a keeper for us. Pros: Super easy, tasty, meatless, serve over rice, pasta Cons: Nothing
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;nhunter;4;I used two canned chipotle peppers instead of the ground chipotle. The flavor really complemented the sweet potato. Served over bulgur wheat, this was a tasty and satisfying supper.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;amyraines;4;First time I made this dish, I followed the recipe as written and found it to be good, but a bit mushy, due to all of the black beans. It was good, but I just didn't love the texture. Second time, I replaced the black beans with cans of organic mixed beans (black, kidney, and pinto) and found it to be much better.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;eirene;3;Spicy goodness Tryied to Followed recipie, except couldn't find Ground chipolte, so used a canned chipolte in adobo sauce. Super spicy, but thought it needed a little sweet, so I added 1/2 cup ketchup. Might sound gross, but it turned out just right, sweet and spicy! Oh, left out the salt as well. Pros: Easy,vegetarian,fiber
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;rgbchic;5;AwesomeI didn't have the chipotle chili pepper so i used red cayenne pepper instead and I still achieved that great heat I was hoping for. Excellent dish, will definitely make it again.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;hadge02;4;Spicy and hearty I used no sodium tomatoes and low sodium beans, added 1 cup of vegetable broth in place of 1 cup of water and it turned out really good.

d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;cpauldin;4;Delicious and healthy! I'd highly recommend this as a meatless entree which will make everyone happy. You can adjust the heat to your taste.

d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;clementine66;5;Absolutely DeliciousThis chili was so delicious-my family ate all of it. Instead of using water, I used some Vegetable Broth to add some more flavors. I didn't use cilantro because we don't like it and added some red pepper flakes for extra spice...delicious, healthy and filling! Didn't miss the meat
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;anonymouseater;4;Delicious Vegetarian chili I love black beans and sweet potatoes. This was such an easy dish to throw together. I didn't have chipotle powder so I used cayenne pepper instead. Loved it!

d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;blondie14688;4;very mild I made this mild version of the chili exactly as the recipe states, without the chipotle pepper. It came out a little too mild for me.

d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;eileen;5;Excellent! This dish is sooooooooo good. It's great on cooler days or when you just want some comfort food. I love the bite the chipotle chile gives this. Add meat if you don't want a veggie meal, but it's great on it's own as well. A must try! Pros: Easy, quick
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;njhousewife;5;Excellent I added a large clove of garlic and a carrot, both chopped, and a chopped poblano chili which i happened to have on hand, as well as a tablespoon of cocoa. After adding the beans I added two cups of vegetable broth and simmered it for an hour. I think the simmering is crucial to develop the flavors. My husband, who does not like sweet potatoes, liked this chili. You will not miss the meat at all. Pros: Quick and easy
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;hmrhodes;5;Healthy and Delicious!This will forever be in my recipe box it's healthy and easy and super tasty! I used less chili powder, more chipotle, more cumin, and a bit of cinnamon. The chipotle powder is a must! It gives a wonderful smoky flavor and gives the dish some depth. I also added some diced chicken breast. This will make a wonderfully comforting lunch or dinner on a chilly fall/winter! Try this one!!Pros: Healthy, easy, tasty, versatile
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;agreatnotion;4;Chipotle is a must! The first time I made this recipe, I didn't have the chipotle powder, so I just used extra dark chili powder. It wasn't nearly spicy enough for me, and the sweetness of the sweet potato overpowered it. The second time I made it, I got chipotle powder and it made a huge difference. I still add a little extra dark chili powder and cayenne pepper because I like spicy chili. I also use/cooked beans that I prepare the night before. Cooking down the sweet potatoes a little thickens it and makes the consistency of the chili closer to meat chili, which I like.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;vibikelady;5;"This is a recipe even meat-lovers enjoy! I have a husband who is basically a meat-and-potatoes guy. This recipe, with no meat at all, had him asking for seconds. I spiced it up a little more with some extra garlic and chili powder and a little more cumin and served it with warm whole-wheat pitas that were perfect for filling with the chili and eating out of hand. My husband gave it his highest praise: ""It's a keeper -- you can make this anytime!"" Pros: quick and easy to make, satisfying and delicious Cons: none"

d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;mixxiepowers;4;Easy and satisfying This was a very easy to prepare meal with lots of good flavor. I usually follow recipes more as a guideline but since this is my first Eating Well recipe and I knew I'd be reviewing I tried to follow it as closely as possible. I wound up accidentally using the whole 28 oz can of diced tomatoes so I added an extra sweet potato. There is so much spice in this recipe I didn't add any extra. Also, I did not have ground chipotle pepper to hand so I used chipotle hot sauce instead. I used the juice from a whole lime which amounted to more than 4 teaspoons but my husband loved that flavor and actually squeezed in the extra wedge of lime I served it with. Also, I wound up chopping more like 3/4 cup cilantro since I LOVE cilantro--especially with lime. I will definitely make this again. My daughter says 'too much cilantro' (but like I said, I added extra) and my husband says 'it was really good'. I served it with extra lime wedges, a dollop of sour cream, corn bread, and a bottle of inexpensive Reisling (Black Swan) which was suprisingly tasty.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;emilyvh;5;YUM! Even better the next day. This was absolutely wonderful. I loved the spices used, and the sweet potatoes complimented the black beans beautifully. Will definitely make again! Pros: One pot.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;smadie3;5;Fabulous Chili!This chili was the best I've ever had! It had soo much flavor and was very easy to make. Sweet potatoes are my favorite food so this was a perfect soup for me. If you haven't made this chili yet you need to!Pros: Quick and healthyCons: None!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;donnamgasilan;5;Great Alternative This was a quick, easy and healthy alternative to chili con carne and did I mention tasty too.. Definitely a keeper Pros: Excellent recipe

d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;dandonian;5;easy, hearty, yummyFollowed recipe and then added a 1/2 can garbanzo beans and a little frozen chopped spinach to bump up texture. Definitely better the next day after flavors have mellowed. I can see how someone would find it too hot if they made and ate in the same day. Chipotle flavor adds a lot of dimension. I served with some shredded sharp cheddar cheese, chopped red onion, chopped cilantro and a tsp of sour cream.

d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;aleash25;4;Surprisingly great!This was a great recipe. Most people I mention it to say HUH? hahaa... It just peaked my interest and Im so glad I tried it. I did not use the chipolte as I like things a little more mild, so I just add a little pepper into each bowl. I also was using frozen tomatoes, so I added two baggies and really like it with a lot of tomatoes. Overall a great healthy dish and something fun to try. Easy & freezable.Pros: So healthy & no meat neededCons: None I can think of
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;eatingwelluser;5;Easy Excellent Chilli This was excellent my family really enjoyed the robust flavor. I followed the recipe and it was easy and very flavorful. I will definitely make this again. Pros: Easy to make, flavorful, and satisfying Cons: None
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;marianela;2;Vegetarian ChiliThis is the 4th recipe I have tried from Eating Well, and I have to say I am disappointed with how off their cooking instructions are. This recipe says to cook until sweet potato is tender..10 to 12 minutes..I went over by 8 minutes thinking I would be fine, and the sweet potatoes were ROCK HARD.. the chili has way too much water in it. The exact same thing happened on a diff recipe. I have now wasted all of these ingredients.Pros: all veggiesCons: incorrect instructions
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;mikeysnana;5;I wonder how it will do with pinto beans instead of black beans and maybe with ground turkey in itI just joined the site and I found this recipe looks yummy, but I am going to try it with pintos instead of black beans and had some ground turkey. I'm trying to get healthy and I love beans.Pros: looks greatCons: haven't made it yet
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;signalflags;4;Good & good for you A delicious, healthy alternative to the usual chili. Did not even require cheese or sour cream, but warm corn bread was a terrific addition. Very satisfying. Pros: easy, perfect chilly weather comfort food Cons: none
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;emmy;5;Easy Delicious Wow This was so easy and wonderful. It was filling and pairs easily with other foods. My husband loved it and I'm using leftovers for my lunches. I only had one tbs of chili powder still awesome!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;thomasgormley;5;Flavorful, aromatic, essential chiliI have to disagree with others that the chili powder is excessive. I think it's spot on, but I also used extra sweet potato which might have balanced it. When I make mine, I use only 2 cups water, and don't rinse the black beans (also get the reduced sodium). This helps create a thicker chili. I also like to slow cook this over a few hours. It really binds the flavors. Also... being in Texas, I needed a little more heat, so I add between 1/4 and 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper.Pros: Flavorful, aromatic, low calorieCons: None
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;madhumass;5;Delicious, easy, fillingI have made huge batches of this recipe a few times already. I find it easier to adjust the heat by omitting chili powder and adding slightly more chipotle powder. I also add some dried mango powder in the end to give it more flavor.This is very easy to put together, does not require fancy implements or ingredients that go bad too soon. I like to use up some leftover veggies (celery, peppers) in this stew to give it more body.Pros: one pot, less mess, easy prep, uses few perishables
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;mallinda;4;Yikes! Thank goodness I had the good sense to only use one tbsp. of chili powder, a bit less chipotle powder, and only 2 tsp. cumin! As it was, this was still a little over my hotness threshold, and I'm not a wimp. Other than that, the chili had a very good taste and is easy to make. Pros: Good taste Cons: Way too spicy!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;louise;4;Very chili chili I made the recipe as it was written and found the 2 Tablespoons of chili powder to be overwhelming. Next time I make it, I will cut that in half. Otherwise, an excellent dish. Pros: spicy, flavorful, colorful Cons: recipe error?
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;akc773;4;Hearty stewEasy and delicious. I added a bit more salt.
12b3e746-d018-4749-88e4-dc8cda99f3f6;angelamcknight;4;I did use agave syrup to sweeten as I made it with milk not juice and plain yogurt. When I use vanilla yogurt, I don‚Äôt use juice but milk. but tonight I only had plain yogurt and no juice hence the use of agave syrup. Recipe worked for me.
12b3e746-d018-4749-88e4-dc8cda99f3f6;shalenaali;3;I used fresh squeezed orange juice, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries. Came out good and tasted good too. However, it was not very filling. Was still hungry after.
12b3e746-d018-4749-88e4-dc8cda99f3f6;jenniferbowyer;4;I have a nutribullet and only needed one serving so i halved it and added milk in place of the fruit juice. I did have to add a bit more milk since i was using frozen fruit. I did have to add some sugar though.
12b3e746-d018-4749-88e4-dc8cda99f3f6;pianoplayer;4;As some other folks were saying, the calories seem exaggerated for such a small drink. It did taste good, in fact very good. The flavors in my pallet were exploding. -Chase
12b3e746-d018-4749-88e4-dc8cda99f3f6;nmm;5;Loved the smoothe. To make my drink a bit sweeter I added honey.
12b3e746-d018-4749-88e4-dc8cda99f3f6;eatingwelluser;4;Great tasting and filling This is a great tasting smoothie! I like it because you can make any flavors you'd like. I use orange juice and mixed berries to make mine. I have NO idea why the carbs count is so high. I plugged the listed stats into my Weight Watchers online and it said 9 points. I freaked out and plugged each item in manually and it came down to 3. Don't go by these nutrition facts, I think they might be way wrong. Pros: Taste, filling, quick, versatile
c555aa60-160b-4581-8b8b-2672234d30a3;abbyz2000;4;I tried to chop the mushrooms so small my mushroom-hater wouldn't see them but I didn't do a good enough job. Next time they'll go in the food processor. The taste is pretty good. Definitely needed the cheese to jazz it up. I ate it without the cheese because I'm on WW and it was a little bland. I also had to add about 6oz more water than the recipe called for and I hadn't even put in 8oz of pasta. I used 5 oz, which was the perfect amount. I don't like pasta to be the majority ingredient in any dish, just personal preference.
c555aa60-160b-4581-8b8b-2672234d30a3;williamrussell;5;I didn't have any mushrooms but we didn't miss them too much and I added diced green peppers and chopped garlic. We enjoyed it as it was quite tasty.
c555aa60-160b-4581-8b8b-2672234d30a3;linda;5;Delish! Family loved it. I did not do mushrooms but carrots instead & added a little brown sugar & a bit more water. This will be a keeper because it‚Äôs fast & easy too. I made broccoli on the side.
c555aa60-160b-4581-8b8b-2672234d30a3;badsarito;5;Do yourself a favor and make this dish! This is a great way to sneak veggies into your family (my adamant non-veggie eating wife and 3 year old both loved it). Real stars of this are the mushrooms and Worcestershire, don‚Äôt skip either!
c555aa60-160b-4581-8b8b-2672234d30a3;thekins133;5;Oh man! You‚Äôre talking about getting kids to eat their vegetables‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm getting my fianc√© to eat his veggies! He has absolutely no idea there are mushrooms in this.Delicious recipe. Like a more flavorful, fancy hamburger helper. Absolutely making this again.
c555aa60-160b-4581-8b8b-2672234d30a3;techiemom;5;LOVE this one-pan recipe! I have made this several times and this is how I make it my own: 1) 1/2 ground beef and ground turkey. I pre-brown and freeze my ground meat for convenience 2) Very finely chopped carrots (i.e. food processor) instead of/in addition to mushrooms. 3) Substituted low sodium beef stock for water. Since my ground meat is strained and I'm not using mushrooms I increase liquid to 1 1/2 cup and may add more during cooking if it seems dry. 3) Substituted 1Tbl Montreal Steak Seasoning for Italian Seasoning/Garlic/Salt. Really gave it a good flavor. I serve with broccoli (finely chop, microwave with about 1 Tbl water loosely covered for 2-4 minutes), and my family mixes it in. Great weeknight meal with easy clean-up.
c555aa60-160b-4581-8b8b-2672234d30a3;stephy0682;3;This recipe was okay. I am only giving it 3 stars because it was just okay. Me and my younger two kids didn't care for the wheat pasta (we used barilla). I will try it again but with my own tweaks. My 4 and 8 year old didn't like it. My husband enjoyed it and so did my 12 year old. I really think it was the wheat pasta. I usually use Barilla Veggie pasta noodles in all of my pasta dishes. I think next time I will use that instead of wheat and I will swap out the Sharp Cheddar Cheese for Mozzarella or Fresh Grated Parm cheese. Overall I made the dish exactly as written the only minor tweak was that I omitted mushrooms. We are not fans of it. But I think if you put your own tweaks you can definitely spruce it up a bit
c555aa60-160b-4581-8b8b-2672234d30a3;nomseek;5;Loved this. Added two cans of diced tomatoes in place of the tomato sauce + 1/2 cup of dry white wine. Yummy!
c555aa60-160b-4581-8b8b-2672234d30a3;jakemehring;5;Added red and green peppers along with the onion and mushrooms and threw everything in the food processor to chop it up real good. It hides all the veggies and adds some great flavor. The whole family loves it!

c555aa60-160b-4581-8b8b-2672234d30a3;nums88;5;I love this it reminds me of my favorite hamburger helper except more healthy. I hate mushrooms so I leave those out and my husband and very picky children all love it
c555aa60-160b-4581-8b8b-2672234d30a3;cbrownenunez;5;Delicious, healthy, and easy. Used organic ingredients and whole grain pasta. Added tomatoes from our garden. Kids loved it!

c555aa60-160b-4581-8b8b-2672234d30a3;abrown062;3;I tried to spice this up a bit but it was still pretty bland
4c30f6ec-c12a-46ac-b142-9137e4fed007;kehillmd;5;This was a great meal. I made some substitutions, though. First, I don‚Äôt like kimchi, so I pan grilled some zucchini and skipped the cucumber too. I subbed cauliflower rice which I put in the wok with onions. I roasted some sweet potatoes and added everything bagel seasoning to the salmon. I thought the Tamar/mirin/ginger sauce needed some extra flavor so I added coconut aminos. I kept the avocado and the sriracha mayo. I crunched up the nori on top. Fantastic
4c30f6ec-c12a-46ac-b142-9137e4fed007;cookinggal;5;Fabulous! I have made it with fresh Salmon and also with Canned Salmon and love it either way! Such great flavor as all the textures and seasonings just work together wonderfully!

4c30f6ec-c12a-46ac-b142-9137e4fed007;ninarae2011gmailcom;5;Fabulous! We loved this recipe. So tasty. Will definitely make it again. We didn't have any kimchi, so made up a quick batch of pickled red cabbage and it worked just as well.
4c30f6ec-c12a-46ac-b142-9137e4fed007;arianek;5;We loved this! We eat a lot of Asian dishes so we had all the ingredients on hand. Only changes were to add spicy fermented radish and ginger carrots to the toppings, plus Ochazuke Nori packets instead of regular nori. The mirin-tamari sauce was especially good.
1619f6bd-936e-4a47-af34-e8ba65aaa4df;judie;5;Love this recipe and make it frequently. I add a sprinkle of salt and pepper and a few shakes of hot sauce. Also, I usually toast the bread.
1619f6bd-936e-4a47-af34-e8ba65aaa4df;tumbarella;5;To switch it up instead of using mixed greens I‚Äôll substitute with alfalfa sprouts or micro greens and sprinkle with some feta cheese. So delicious!
1619f6bd-936e-4a47-af34-e8ba65aaa4df;katkin09;5;Delicious. I‚Äôve made this twice- first time per the recipe and then the second time I added julienned sun dried tomatoes that I made into another spread with a food processor. I will never leave those out again.

1619f6bd-936e-4a47-af34-e8ba65aaa4df;ronhebert;5;Amazing Sandwich. I've been wanting it again, since Monday. So tasty and filling!
1619f6bd-936e-4a47-af34-e8ba65aaa4df;patriciabaughman;5;Delicious and easy. I used organic multigrain sandwich bread from Whole Foods, and filled with salad, grated carrots and black olives.
